Making mass.gov data-driven and constituent centric
Speaker(s):BRYAN HIRSCH
Too many pages to refresh, needs a strategy
Start at the top, top 20% of content (80/20 rule)
10% of content serves 89% of page requests
paths aligns with 20 different clusters for gov services
Lot of work to be compliant for disabilities
Validately
Unstrutured data vs structured data
page metaphore is evaporating, title and body is useless and outmoded
need to think in terms of chunks of data

Keynote - Agile Design
Speaker(s):KELLY ALBRECHT
Adaptibility to a change in the situation is agility (think Spiderman)
Agility is more than adapting to change
Deliberation vs Hair Trigger Action
"Your agility is measured by the speed and effectiveness of your response"
Ceremonies, built into process where you respond to changes - stand ups, etc
Values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, Courage
Issues arise when there is a violation of one of these values
Very few of us are not doing the best we can
Very few of us are intentionally doing poorly
Iteration: Iterations provide an optimized awareness into a larger effort
getting into a shippable implement- make the best version of this you can
breaking larger things into workable pieces
Planning reduces stress
Wherever complex design exists, there must have been a designer - Thomas Aquinas
Agility is bringing good thinking to action quickly
Agile does not tell us not to have a plan, but to always be planning
The idea is Red is good in retrospectives
good to know what to fix and where issues lay
Make it easy to change later

Keynote - Responsive Design: Beyond Our Devices
Speaker(s):ETHAN MARCOTTE
