DrupalCon Notes	

After #WCRaleigh I headed to Balimore MD to DrupalCon 2017.  
This is THE BIG SHOW for Pantheon!  The biggest event for Drupal every year. This was the 4th one I have attended in the US, 5th overall.  My first DrupalCon was in Austin, TX in 2014.  It literally changed my life.  Before that event Pantheon was just a really awesome job in the valley, for sure my favorite so far.  But from day one of that event a few years back I realized that Drupal was way more than a pile of code.  It was a real community.  
It was also where it first hit me what the heck Free Open Source Software was really all about. Free as in speech, not as in beer.  Walking away from this year, I had been reminded of that point and feel an urgent renewed purpose for making this whole free and open internet thing work.  More on that later.


My week at DrupalCon started with the Community Summit.  This is meant for the folks who have organized community events like DrupalCamps, Meetups or anything else community focused.  I arrived fairly late in the day, due to a few travel hiccups.  The day was already in full swing and I raced to catch up, which was not too hard since everyone was eager to help me get on the same page.  I was very grateful to be included in the conversation and feel I saw some real progress in the team I joined.  It was awesome to work with my fellow MidCamp organizer Avi (TWITTER HERE) and longtime partner Aiden Foster (TWITTER) to further the cause of making Drupal Community happen.  I highly encourage you to go participate locally and do what you can to keep things growing.  

Directly after the community summit ended, the conference floor opened up to attendees to meet and greet the sponsors.  This is when we got to roll out this year's version of Booth Demo Magic.  This is one of my favorite things about working at Pantheon.  It is part magic show, part TED talk and part "Mother of all Demos" https://youtu.be/yJDv-zdhzMY.  This is where we unveil the amazing work we have done and get people fired up about the future of the state of the art. 
This year was the best year in in my attending.  Watching the demo is the only way to get a Pantheon shirt, which is screen printed in front of you on demand and in previous years, this was the main reason a lot of people who already knew us watched the presentation. This year, dropping the names of tech we were going to show how we integrate with caused such a huge stir that I think we might have had the same turnout even if we didn't have the best shirt of the convention.  As people passed and I said "Do you want to see CircleCI with automated testing setup from a single CLI command" heads snapped our direction, eyebrows raised up and people turned around to go find a place to sit in front of our screens.  It was amazing.  Really set the tone for the rest of the con.

Food and the Fun:

Monday night dinner:
Every year Pantheon sends a large number of us Pantheors to DrupalCon and many of these folks work remotely.  DrupalCon gives us a rare chance to sit down as a group and have a good meal. We were not disappointed by the friendly staff and quality of food from Roy's Hawaiian Fusion.  Very tasty and I found out there is a 'secret vegetarian' menu they do not advertise but which has some pretty creative offerings.  If you go, ask for it.

#Drupalcrawl
https://twitter.com/jmickela/status/856670942076035072
No Drupal event of this size would be complete without a good old fashioned bar crawl and I left the Pantheon team dinner to join the unofficial official #Drupalcrawl as it pulled into the last scheduled stop, Tír na nÓg Irish Bar & Grill.   It was so great to see so many of my friends from all over the world in one spot to raise a glass to Drupal.  Special shout out to the crawl organizer Jason Mickela (TWITTER LINK).  He is one of the nicest people ever and the smoothness, inclusiveness and togetherness of this event re-enforced that notion.  If you are looking for a low stress thing to do with your local Drupal (or any other) community, suggest a pub crawl and let the bars do the heavy lifting.  


Tuesday
At the show:
Coffee before a keynote was mandatory and I dug into my 'snack bag' for breakfast, which is mostly almonds and a few other goodies to keep me going on the road.  Coffee was abundant and OK for a trade show. 
Lunch on the other hand was absolutely amazing.  I went with the special meals option and was rewarded with fresh and delicious food that looked way better than what was on the buffet lines.  I had a delecately crafted mushroom ravioli and pretty great veggies on the side.  The care and attention to folks with dietary restrictions was pretty epic and I applaud the Baltimore Convention Center catering team. Well done! 

Tuesday Partner Dinner:
Working primarily with agencies here at Pantheon over the last 3 years I have had the extreme pleasure of getting to be part of the Partner Dinner at DrupalCon, an annual tradition to say thanks to the fine folks at our partner agencies that leverage our product for their livelihoods.  It is such an honor to get to sit and talk with these folks and hear the stories of how their lives have been impacted by the tech we work on.  
The food was pretty OK.  For the second time that day I went with a mushroom ravioli and a very lovely bowl of berries for dessert.  Not to knock this place but the lunch was, by comparison, on par with the quality of this upper scale private dining venue.  I ate my fill and I think they nailed portion sizes, which was great because I didn't need to be in a food coma to make it to the next stop:

DrupalCon Karaoke!
If you have been reading this, you already know how much I love karaoke.  The music, the drinks, the togetherness and most importantly the act of publicly displaying the love for a song.  We were in real luck in Baltimore as the Tin Roof (LINK) had live band karaoke!  A four piece band backed up singers, giving them the choice of hundreds of songs.  They even claimed to know many more than were in the songbook but they listed out the most popular for us all.  There were about 100 Drupal folks gathered together and we didn't all get the chance to take the stage, but we all had a chance to cheer and sing along.  The band was even so gracious as to extend their time.  Being a particularly dark and rainy night in Baltimore, we got the vibe that without the love of the con-goers they would have wrapped it up early and called it a loss.  Thanks to the good Drupal community believing enough we made it one of their best nights ever we were repeatedly told.  Karaoke is an amazing way to bring folks together.  Make sure you are singing with your community!

Wednesday
Again, the lunch options for special diets were pretty good, though I had the bar set extremely high the previous day, so I wasn't as bowled over.  I had a poblano stuffed pepper with daiya and I think cashew based filling. That part was awesome.  The rest of the meal was chips and run of the mill guac.  Living in California I will admit I am completely spoiled on fresh super high quality avocados, so most pre-packaged guacamole is belh at best.  Desert was a cookie, which I did not try.  Coffee was pretty OK too.     

Wednesday night brought the largest of the out of venue events: 
The Lullabot/Pantheon party!   Every year this party gets a little bigger and wilder.  This year was the biggest yet and was a real hands on experience.  The party took place at the Maryland Science Center!  We were surrounded by dinosaurs, interactive exhibits and all sorts of fun and drinks.  Really an amazing time and so many good memories made.  The photo booth was hopping from open until they kicked us out at the end.

The un-official after party:
https://twitter.com/chrisod/status/857442528559235072
All I will say about this is vegan liquid nitrogen ice cream, Chaz Chumly (Twitter) on DJ duty, Kalamuna (twitter) to the rescue on supplies and community making a crazy night awesome! Thats about all I can say. Other than that, you really just had to be there.  After all...what we do is secret. https://youtu.be/h3h4-mUmO48 
 

Thursday 
The morning started with much, much coffee and the best keynote of DrupalCon! Lunch was a pretty solid veggie wrap, chips and fruit. Of the 3 days, this was the most standard convention fare of the week on the special diets menu.  Nothing to complain about but nothing so outstanding as that ravioli on day one.  
For dinner there was a large contingent of folks I like going to get some crab, which Maryland is pretty famous for.  I accompanied them to get a drink but looked elsewhere for food.  I was certainly glad I did for a couple reasons.  
First, it was the best greens I hav ever eaten at this pretty awesome vegan soul food joint called The Land of Kush http://landofkush.com/menu/ Even if you are not down with the only plant based food path, seriously go check this place out.  Pretty epic food at ridiculously low prices given the portions.  (INSERT PIC)
The other reason I was glad to have split off was the walk back.  Yes I walked across Baltimore and I think I hit every best neighborhood in the whole city on that walk.  Baltimore is only known by many folks because of The Wire.  This show focuses exclusively on crime in "America's Finest City" What they leave off is there are parts where it feels like the nicest parts of Manhattan or DC.  From the Washington Monument (LINK) to Power Plant Live (LINK), I followed a path filled with quiet parts, statuary, interesting and very old architecture.  I felt very safe the whole time and recommend this walk if you ever get the chance to be in this east coast gem of a town.  

Trivia Night!  
My official end of DrupalCon was once again this fun filled evening of trivia and fun with us answering some interesting and at times frustrating questions at VENUE!!!  It was great to work with my old friend Jeremy RaNAME TWITTER and some new friends to have a good time and a few laughs.  It was an ideal way to cap off the event and I left exhausted but very happy.

The Sessions:

Since I was there to hustle at the Booth Demo Magic I didn't get a chance to see many sessions.  I did see a few though and really wish I had been able to see more.  


The Prenote! 
Every year JAM (TWITTER) is the Master of Ceremonies for this lighthearted spectacle, designed to get us awake and ready for the Driesnote and the rest of the day.  This year there was a bit of a somber, slow start.  As you might know there was some controversy in the Drupal community over the last few months and JAM addressed this at the start.  It was a plea for healing and provided a few links with resources he thinks will help guide us to be a better community overall.  
With the tone now set to a bit darker than expected, we saw a colorful cast of costumed characters emerge on stage and the real prenote fun turned on.  We met a green haired DrupalCon newbie named "B. Ginner" who was shown the ropes by a whacky bunch of community folks through song and dance.  The biggest lesson is that at DrupalCon, "you can't go two steps without a hug".  In fact this is offically part of the PHP coding standard, PSRB8: 	PSR8 https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/psr-8-hug/psr-8-hug.md
If I had not already sensed it, this was the signal that DrupalCon was going to be good this year.  Really good.

Here are my unfiltered notes:
"Sorry I hurt you, It hurts to see you hurting.  Q&A best time to talk about that"
Focus on software
Drupal 8.3 
15,000 sites per month launch with D8
Ambitious 
YMCA not just a website, interconnectivity between systems is powerful
Drupal has evolved, from project for hobby to something as a powerful to power things
"enterprise" is misleading, non-profits and libraries are not really enterprises
Ambitous digital experience
ecosystem is ambitious as well.
"I was right" city of SF story
Lot of modules to port, please do that
1 million D7 sites need to be migrated
6 month release cycles are important
Depricated APIs will still be supported
D9 will Be d8 without the deprecated pieces
Going to make upgrade path simple and lot of time to update code as D8 evolves
8->9 should be as easy as 8.2->8.3
7-8 might be the last hard upgrade
Core team has added 4 people, with hundreds of hours of contrib
Previews of what is coming
impressive editorial process changes
autorespond-bot is on git hub (based on obama admin whitehouse work)

Project management the musical!
The first non-note talk I got to see was "Project Management The Musical!" by the amazing due of Allison Mannly TWITTER and Joe Allen Black TWITTER.  This was to be the final performance as they were retiring the session.  I had been there over a year before in Midcamp when they had premiered it and was eagerly looking forward to see the last show in the run.  It knocked my socks off and for only the second time in any session I have attended, I was part of a standing ovation.  The other time was the opening show they did.  
Rather than explain a musical to you, it is best to just go check it out here: LINK TO A COPY!!!!

Jam and Mattias from Typo3

This one caught my eye as it was on the community stage and featured one of Drupal's more colorful characters, the awesome mustachioed JAM, from the prenote.  He was presenting with an unexpected guest, Mattias LINK from Typo3 community. If you are not familiar with their PHP CMS project, you should take a look.  They use some of the same PHP libraries and there is a lot ot learn from it, much like we can learn from WordPress or Joomla.  
What they spoke about shook me to my core and was a personal wake up call.  I make my living off of the open source world and that world is under attack.  They explained that although free and open source software seeminly has won the battle for acceptance in the enterprise world, that fight is far from over.  While we have enjoyed a golden era of FOSS acceptance as the seemingly default 'right' approach, the large proprietary software makers have not gone away or even shrank.  They are using their size and vaults to lobby for position harder than ever.  They duo shared a few stories that have left me concerned in ways I had not thought about before. 
First: 
There is a set of laws on the books, but not yet enacted in placed like France that say a CMS must have a creator maintained SLA. Yes, that means all CMS must have a creator to deliver SLA for their software to be considered for government contract.  Who would be eligible in Drupal or WordPress? They also discussed the Canadian government's recent RFP that was written to exclude open source on similar grounds.  This is a troubling trend. 
meaning no SLA.  
They shared Joomla's story of temporarily losing tax status for their event governing organization.  This would have been disasterous had the other open source communities not banded together to help define German tax law.  How close did we come to a slippery slope there?  Too close to comfort for me. 
The good news here is that it is not too late.  We still have an upper hand as we have a whole community to act, which is more valuable than any pile of cash.  We just need to work together to continually make the slice of the pie bigger for all
##
##Typo3 has a tricky sounding created business entity for being the owner/creator of software
Drupal, Canadian laws, RFP written for Pro CMS
Joomla Assoc Germany
Founded legal framewwork for event
Non-profit by law has to be work for 'greater good'
Typo3 set up legal fund and pretected us all defining greater good

Pie game: Market is about $10B global
Screw marketshare. Think turnover!!
Let's stop fighting and start wonning
OSS business 
Open Inbound (inbound marketing platform built in D8)
Our lunch is totally eaten by site builders
no business below a certain $ number

Wednesday

Keynote: 
Extending Dreis note

----------
Wait, there are 35 Symfony Components? What Cool Stuff am I Missing?
weaverryan
PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THIS SESSION
DrupalCon Baltimore 2017:

What is Symfony *really*? It's a collection of *35* independent libraries, and
Drupal uses less than *half* of them! That means that there's a *ton* of other
good stuff that you can bring into your project to solve common problems... as
long as you know how, and what those components do!

In this talk, we'll have some fun: taking a tour of the Symfony components, how
to install them (into Drupal, or anywhere) and how to use some of my *favorite*,
lesser-known components. By the end, you'll have a better appreciation of what
Symfony *really* is, and some new tools to use immediately.

Keynote: Technology and Its Workforce at an Ethics Crossroad
As information technology matures and becomes integral to more and more of everyday life, and as the early freewheeling era gives rise to a few dominant corporations or the widespread use of technology to surveil citizens, to replace or control workers, or to optimize decision-making mostly for the benefit of powerful, what are the options and responsibilities of the technology workforce--a workforce that benefits from the rise of these new technologies but is also increasingly confronted with uncomfortable questions about where the work they do stands in historical terms. This talk will explore some of the leading challenges and raise questions as the era of information technology transforms from its pirate era to the CEO era.   

Join Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor who studies the intersection between technology and society, focusing on the myriad of impacts of digital connectivity and computational decision-making. Her forthcoming book is titled "Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protestsb" She contributes regularly to the New York Times.
