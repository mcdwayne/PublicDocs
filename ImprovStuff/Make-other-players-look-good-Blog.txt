You are all supporting actors-Del Close

Documentation and Support

-> Theater:

It is very, very rare to see a solo improvised show.  While they do exists, the vast majority of the time improv theater is a team activity.  And in reality even in solo shows are heavily reliant on the audience as co-conspirators to make the show work.  One of the underlying elements of improv is supporting the choices other players make and as Del said, 'make them look like geniuses.

First this means sometimes just being a supporting actor.  Literally being lower status on a totem pole to help someone else explore their character and story.  We have to make certain decisions to sometimes play the straight man, or the side kick and simply provide background support, like a waiter or extra, in a scene.  While not the first person we think of when we imagine the hero's journey, without R2D2 or Sancho Panza or Q, our heros Luke Skywalker, Don Quixote or James Bond would not likely have done as well as they had.  Playing this essential, but not 'starring' role is required to make the piece work (####link ot serve the piece not the form####) 

But also in the larger sense, every tingle time you are on stage we should strive to make the other player look as great as they can.  This really comes down to making them look amazing instead of causing conflict or negating them.  The best improvisors support all ideas and give their fellow players all they need to succeed.

To that point, there is an improv award show in Chicago called the "Jeff" awards which gives trophies to impactful players nominated and selected by their peers.  The first person who ever won a Jeff award made a speech about how the award marked him as a failure since he stood out and clearly didn't make his fellow improvisors look as good as he could.  I like this story because it illuminates what great improvisors strive to do.  No matter what is thrown at them, no matter how 'off the rails' a scene gets, they are ready to bend over backwards to go along with the other player's ideas and make them look amazing in the process.  


-> Development:

In development we have the same responsibility.  Beyond just making ourselves look great we must consider the 'other players' who will interact with our code.  We can think of these players in a couple different different bread categories, which I am calling 'End Users' and 'Engineers'. 

By End Users, I mean the people who will make use of your application or site who have no real knowledge of how it does what it does.  Our duty to them is to make them look like geniuses. If they can navigate and be successful with what they want to do, without having to stop and think, they are going to have a better experience and likely a better day because of your support.  Make them look badass and people will notice.  

Engineers I am defining as anyone who will ever need to look at your documentation and code.  This ranges from other developers who will be building from our code, who will rely on your comments to customer support professionals who will be reading your documentation.  If they can quickly and easily make sense of your code and docs, they can more quickly deliver results to their end users and in turn make everyone look amazing.  It simply is not enough to ship something that functions.  We must strive to make our deliverables supportable and extendable if we are to progress as professionals and as a community.  
I think the basic sentiment is captured nicely by something my colleague Andrew [LASTNAME NEEDED) put it: "It is up to you to ask questions AND answer them to make everyone look good."

I would argue that development, just like improvised stagecraft, is also always a team sport.  Even the solo developer stands on the shoulders of giants to even start coding.  Fortunately for all of us those that came before who gave us compilers, frameworks and even the languages we code in, did so in a way to support us.  Mak sure you are supporting others with your work and making them look as good as possible.  


-> How to practice this with your peers?


Gift Giving 
Divide your groups into pairs.  (a group of 3 will work as well) 
Decide who goes first, this is now Player 1.  

Player 1 will mime picking up a random shaped object and give it to Player 2 and say "I got this for you" (The shape of the object is irrelevant, but do vary it up, giving these imaginary objects different sized and weights.   
Player 2 receives the gift taking from Player 1's hands and says "Just what I always wanted..." and states what they think would fit this object size, shape and weight, of the object they are now holding.  

The goal should be to support the other player and make a guess to what they would logically be holding with that size and shape.  
However, there are no wrong answers here.  There is no way on earth to be wrong.  If someone hold out their arms wide and you say it is a bowling ball, then it is a big bowling ball.  If you say it is the Queen Mary II, then that is what it is.  

TL:DR
Improv is a team sport and sometimes you play the straight man or sidekick. No matter what though you make moves that support and set people up for success.  
As developers you should make your end users look like geniuses. Document by asking questions and answering them so futre engineers will be able to build and support your work.
