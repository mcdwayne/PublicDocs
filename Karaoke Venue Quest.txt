Looking for space to rent for a Karaoke party on Saturday 7/15

Hi

I am looking to rent an event space for Karaoke from ~7:00pm to ~midnight on Saturday 7/15 in the downtown/theater district area of Buffalo.
Space needs: ~150 person capacity 

Equipment need: Projector, Mics and sound system I can hook a laptop into to make a Karaoke system happen.

It is for an official after party for this: https://2017.wpcampus.org/location/

I am an improv producer and performer in SF and would love to do this event at your venue, if you think it might be a fit.
As I am not local to Buffalo, if you think this is a bad fit for your location I would greatly appreciate any pointers to alternatives.  

Cheers,

Dwayne
