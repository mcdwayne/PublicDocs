Chris Lema
Product Market Fit is more about the market than the product
- This is not an engineering exercise

Empathy is often the missing element
This isn't a feeling. It is an ability to step into the shoes of someone else

Power, Flexible and Easy do not go together. 

Copywriters should be as critical to your launch as developers
Do you research before a launch?

Messaging should be targeted and timely

If you assume you'll be compared to others you'll likely stop writing/saying stupid shit

The broader your appeal,th e harder it is to know if you are getting traction

By focusing on a segment, their message gets tighter and customers can easily self-select (in or out)

Pain - "We know your struggle"
Claim p "We're here for you"
Gain - There is hope"
This is a loss aversion strategy that has been scientifically proven to work



Chris Lema 12/2 Finding your voice through blogging  WCUC

STOP FILTERING YOUR INNER VOICE
If someone criticized your editing in comments, there is a special icon you can click that deletes those comments.  

START WRTITING A LOT

Stop stressing.  Press Publish.
             
Start by copying from others.

Stop Blending in! (be the unique you that you are)  

Start looking back.  What motivates you?  

Stop tracking all the things.  

Start collecting frames (Shortcuts)
