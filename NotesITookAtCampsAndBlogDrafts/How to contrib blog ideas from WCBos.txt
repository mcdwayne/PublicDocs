-----------------------

My thoughts
People auto gathered in groups, with the bulk condensing to the cor table.  

working a long time, afraid to leave the house
understand

What do yo do with WP

Themes custom plugin work
not great with dealing directly with people
that is OK, everyone can contribute
SO SUpport the team is very boisterous

Theme team is INTENSE< no off witch
Plugin team is on lockdown
Docs though, bredth of knwelde
because he is a developer

that lit a spark in him
excited he can help 
without leaving his little box

"aught to have more WP friends"

but not all everything is overcomable

Does not negate that you are giving to and part of the community

DO want to give back, WP has supported me for a long time
selfishly, if do this, then not just in his head, sitting with his sadness reading blog posts, can only learn so much from that, have to expose yorself to people and learn
no tother wayt og et it thant o get it
reach ot as have questions

A lot harder today than was 7 years ago or so

Mike had a problem with mod security
someone had an htaccess question
she knew answer
slowly started answering questions
got invited to moderation team
had to check email on phone to get recaps, could'nt be on IRC
worked at a back
blogging about the problems she was solving, likes to write
has an interesting voice
WC SF invited her, 
she never spoke before, was terrified, went well, lead to DreamHost job
Don't regret
