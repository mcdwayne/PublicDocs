Markting Team Contributor Day Recap from WC ABQ

The marketing team participated in WordCamp Albuquerque's Contributor Day on Sunday 1/21/2018
Team members present:
@mcdwayne, @kitty, @angela, @heatherm

The main focus for the camp was working on:
“Navigating Trac guide for new people core.trac.wordpress.org”
https://trello.com/c/g3z2GbSX/47-navigating-trac-guide-for-new-people-coretracwordpressorg

@mcdwayne and @kitty took on the task of turning @flixos90's presentation of beginning use of Trac into a Google Doc:

Meanwhile @angela attended the 'getting started as a core contributor' session lead by WHOWASLEADINGTHISAGSIN?  and took notes of the general overview she received for Trac:

 @kitty worked out an outline for a new user guide, including minumum criteria for the intended guide user, which was discussed in depth by the rest of the team over lunch, resulting in this document:

 After debating the merits and disadvantages of a single doc for both outline and draft vs using a second dedicated doc for the drafting of the guide itself, only to find ourselves equally divided on preferred approach, we flipped a coin and went with the 2 document approach. Draft is here:

 It was a very good day.
