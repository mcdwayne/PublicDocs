[Can't we all just git along?](https://nedcamp.org/new-england-drupal-camp/sessions/cant-we-all-just-git-along)
[Erik Peterson](https://twitter.com/eporama)

Not a 'how to'
not things you will have to do
help understand what git is doing and what it is trying to do 
how to fix things when they break
logic behind it
Tim Berglund's "git from the bits up" is where he got the idea
setting up git
git config --global
file that manages config
initialize a repo
init
that is all you need to do
what did that actually do?
that is meat of talk
What git tries to track
Objects and Refs
Blob - data of the files
Treees - pathing for a blob and other trees
Commits - tree, parent, comments
REFS
	Tags - named commit
	Heads/Branches - line of commits you can add to
Working directory - the actual files on your disk
Repository - history of all the changes
.git directory in the Working Directory
Commits
Each commit has an identifier hash
commits play one after the other
commit messages should be robust
People expect a master branch
Starting with Raw Build
Creating directory structure
hash-objects command
mothing object into index
git update-add
DEMO TIME
mkdir .git
mkdir .gitobjects
mkdir -p .git/refs/heads
refs/heads/master > .git/HEAD
git hash-object 
most OS hate large folders
objects in file 10K OK, 10M not ok
git generates huge number of files
everything is stored as objects in git
hashes breaks off first characters and makes new folders out of them
Directory + file is the hash
Still no commit, but no file
exists as a file somewhere, but not checked out
does not know what it is or anything about it
add it to the index 
git updateindex -add --cacheinfo 100644 hasidentifier spiral.txt
git write-tree
git cat-file -c hash
git cat-file -p hash
git commit-tree hash
git cat-file -p
adding spiral file
Point of all this 
a commit is just a pointer to trees
trees just paths to objects
objects just files in git folder
Git cleanup looks for objects that are not in trees, kill those
head branch detached when not pointed at branch, pointed at specific commit
don't want to be on a commit, be on a branch with that commit
checkout rewrites your working directory
Rebase and Reset
branching - you can just commit your whole life through
moving to new branch lets other people work on your repo and keep working on your idea
like you didn't do the work if you want to toss it
objects are still there, branch is gone though
rep log to see changes and bring branch back
merging is getting branches back together
real trees rarely do this
remembers the paths and both branches
then can get rid of branch
rebase is different
a git mere is also a rebase
that is a fast forward merge
rebase moves the base fo your branch to a different parent
changing what it is based off of
makes it look like one branch
whole history you are testing against
fetching
vs git pull
pull does a lot
fetch just gets all work done from the remote branch
but nothing else, lets you control what to rebase against
git push me, pull you
git reset soft
moves head pointer wherever, leaves working directory alone
tree (brew install tree)
git branch --contains hash
little history commit

[The command-line doesn't have to be a black box](https://nedcamp.org/new-england-drupal-camp/sessions/command-line-doesnt-have-be-black-box) ;)
[Jim Fisk](https://twitter.com/jimafisk)

he found himself doing a lot of things with tools
found himself going more and more to command line
wrote this talk to help show others how he found success with it
We will over Docker
Vesl, tmux, vim, and others
basics
how to naviagate find where you are, move things, and edit files
basically anything you can do through gui you can do through command line
quicker
Navigational thing
pwd - print working directory
ls - list files
see . and ..
. is folder you are in
.. one leve up
cd - nav around the file system
Docker, container service isolated environments that can souse your dependencies and run different version of software in a consistant way. based on your project requirements
just type 'docker' see list of commands
all based on a common image you can download and connect containers
'docker ps' to see what is running
he created a project that made config easier
called Vesl (on dockerhub)
bas script, complex docker commands and make them easier to run
bloated container that out of the box, ready to go faster though
Vesl loads things behind the scenes from blueprints
DEMO
vesl start container 
Fish is shell on top of your commands
fish shell goes ghosting, efficiently run things, autocomplete
predictive text autocomplete, even if not same start of word, related terms
tmux
terminal multiplexer
have multiple shells within shells
why need terminal shells in shells?
ssh 2x and edit in one
tmux bar gets added to bottom
vim - can configure 
shortcuts
demo
at the start of what we can do with vim
vim config that helps you do things like debug easier
:w
:q
Fugitive - vim plugin
seatags
tig - better git history git backwards
history of changes and commit messages 
see diffs on file by clicking on commit
tree view
look through actual files at that point
edit the old fie without pulling in memory
mysql cli

[Inclusion and Diversity in the Ever-growing Global Digital Marketplace.](https://nedcamp.org/new-england-drupal-camp/sessions/inclusion-and-diversity-ever-growing-global-digital-marketplace)
[Aimee Degnan](https://twitter.com/aimeeraed)

How do we identify yourself
project manager
dev, site builder
her into slide and her tech history
do tech
Women owned business 20+ years expereince
but who are you really?
race, class, educatio, sexuality, ability, age, gendr, ethnicity, custure, language
lot of the audience looks male 
but not sure how we identify inside
get more data
then this is where ask questions and listen what we say
that is diversity
being composed of different elements
this is for people, the ture rane of differences
the meanig of diversity os not the stat of being differnert, it is noticing and listeng and respecting the differences in others
inner/outer wheel
inner are some things can't contril, like ago, national origin
outside are things you can change, appearance, work exp,, Educatin, Family, Political 
fluidity 
Different is scary
sometimes hard to find connection points
we like to be around people like us as humans
people find comparisons
you can tell if someone is safe if they are familiar
perceived confidence
but different can be empowering
different brings new ideas, new needs, brings change
society comes with lot of societal baggage
Privelege exists, we must acknoklede it
dominant, most influential
Oppressed, subserviance and hardship, especially by the unjust exercise of authoritysomeone ho feels depressed
if don't speak the language you could have a temporary oppression
intersectionality
trait 1 + traint 2 = total identity
most people have many more than 2
instead of rosie the riveter being a white woman
3 woman of color, one in hijab
inclusion example of intersectionality
she had hesitations on putting this together
admitting how she is oppressed and privileged
being a tech business leader is how she is afarid of being judged
will she say too many feminist or radical things
awareness
hole built for a circle, other shapes are told by circle "just be yourself and get out"
need to be aware not just of ourself but other people and the situation
cycles of oppression and privileged 
in order for a disadvantaged group to get better situation have to take on traits of dominant opressive class
inflammation - pain cycle - tht you can fix with Advil, not privilege 
have to have systemic change to fix
Inclusion - being part of a group or structure
integration says stay in your cicle, but no effort to include
inclusion must be cultivated
but be careful not to have assimilation
inclusion is including people as they are, changing the system around the people's neds
assimilation says change to fit in
homogeneity vs heterogeneity
made of same parts vs different parts
equality vs equity
fence in the way, looking at the problem different
addressing systematic issues
Digital divide
digital privilege
gap has improved over time
worse things happening content censorship and denial of access
accross the board, internet is helping with inclusion
content
Drupal is 4.8% of the internet
Digital innovations, like Google translate 
translation programs only getting better
why does this matter
where did Drupal start?  and by who?
so many languages covered in the Drupal project
Your behavior and acions matter
be an ally
sometimes you don't know the right thing to do
you can ask what the other person needs and help them, it is OK
be aware communication is beyond language
talk about change vs living change
Empathetic actions
be nice to each other
sounds easy, but not really
change is a process, takes time
is ongoing
must have an intent to improve
Yes we can!

[Opening the Black Box: Becoming a Better Developer Through Debugging](https://nedcamp.org/new-england-drupal-camp/sessions/opening-black-box-becoming-better-developer-through-debugging)
[Dustin Younse](https://twitter.com/milsyobtaf)


Examples of errors taking down things
funny tweets
Nothing but text
CSS, Aggregated byt not cached
JS blocked in the browser
File permissions 
differences between debugging and troubleshooting
5 minutes vs 5 hours
fixed vs understand why it happened and corrected that
What is the black box?
no CS degree or background, self taought web skills
everyone wanted a website, he would do it for beer money
above average google abilities
late nights staring at error codes
Mental model of drupal a black cube
thing that did stuff
changed ental model to "Maniac Magee"
kids book
can untangle knots
largest knot in the world, he studies it
bootstrap process is complex
got harder in D8
let's look at some new tools
When all you have is a hammer...
need better tools
"text editors" - notepad, nano
vs text editors - notepad++, Sublime
vs IDEs - more specialized - phpstorm, eclipse, komodo
how we set up Dev environment
FTP development - cowboy coding and ftp
no versio control, this is bad
Local Dev - MAMP/Native LAMP
can work offline
print_r()
xdebug possible
Local Dev Next Gen
Kalabox/Lando - Pantheon and Acquia prehooked
behave like the server you will be hosted on
more performance profiling
blackfire - newrelic but local
XHProf
Tidewater
XDebug: step through debugging
hitting pause on code execution
inspect the state of the stack
modify values live
hairy problematic issue story 
something is broken!
the ever dangerous live demo
example with chrome debugging tool for JS
modifying as goes walking through step by step, break points
looking at things as they are running
found off by one error
what is broken?
is something not showing up?
new content -is it published?
Log files
learn how to find your log files before you need your log files
multitail
linux/mac utility to easily view logs with more options than tail
tail multiple files at once
where is it broken?
custom module
template.php/.theme file
theme template?
since we don't hack core or contrib modules
Change one thing at a time
git is your friend
save progress
recreate 
make rabit holes managable
git bisect id your friend
lets you isolate changes between commits
must have multiple commits on branches and master
start in the middle
imagine a 45 step teddy bear factory
Git diff is our friend
remove your debug statements
ensure you only changes as much as you needed to change
git blame
git annotate
find out who wrote the offending code
not a witch hunt
a chance to find context
you can go ask 'person' and might be more info you needed to know
or time specific
debigging techniques
walk away, seriously
talk to a coworker (pair program)
talk to a rubber duck 
write ti down by hand, show your work
make the future easier
watchdog
drupal::logger
etc

[Did you say taxonomy or content type?](https://nedcamp.org/new-england-drupal-camp/sessions/did-you-say-taxonomy-or-content-type)
[Benji Fisher](https://twitter.com/benji17fisher)

developing vocabulary 
builds a Drupal site
manage fields manage forms
name=author
ends up with 
All english
all dead
all white guys
copyright 
Emily Dickenson is a solid choice
page for williams blake
taxonomy for blake
how you are going to edit the content type
same here
content type
poet info the same in both 
What difference does it make
drupal for free
revisions, created, timestamps, bulk operations
Drupal also gives taxonomy
heirarchy
drag and drop ordering
list of associated content (nodes)
Demo of admin, reminded of what Drupal dev looks like
Revisions to taxonomy terms, module for that
created and changed timestamps
author info
bulk operations
drag and drop ordering
list of associated content
Admin experience
willyou provide custom navigation
Database!  
Node Tables
