NERDSummit 2019: 

I arrived into [Ol' Beantown]() just in time to enjoy their world renown rush hour traffic for my I drive over to the little town of Amherst, Massachusetts.  Given that I very rarely drive a car or listen to 3 hours of NPR in a sitting, this was not actually all that bad of a situation.  There is a mindfulness that attentive driving takes while also freeing up other parts of the brain to engage with sounds and ideas not critical to the success of operating a vehicle. It actually occurred to me that I possibly picked up crochet because I subconsciously missed this mental state that lets me focus on one thing while learn and ponder completely different things. This long travel day was very much rewarded by amazing weekend full of old and new friends as we gathered on the [UMass Amherst]() campus for [NERDSummit 2019](http://nerdsummit.org)

[What is Kubernetes, and Why Should I Care?](http://nerdsummit.org#6)
[Geri Jennings](https://twitter.com/izgerij)


Secrets, but not today
Kubernetes
2016, SaaS company, GCP
Knew some Docker and liked idea
didn't know how production of that would work
cube-control
KAS
containers: a star is born
docker, 2014 - defined the space
container runtime images
not the only one now
Kube allows you to docker vs VM
architecture is different
VM on a Hypervisor
vs
Docker Engine, containers on top of engine
(linux)
otherwise it is Docker on a VM
you define an image, a snapshop of the container
run image to get container
you write a Docker file
Thats nice, but how do we get it to production?
Start with a dev that used containers
why wouldn't prod use containers?
keep everything consistent is the theory
Deploying containers
understand how to run containers
networking so they cant alk to each other
interact with other systems
persistent storage and monitoring
Enter Kubernetes
it is an orchestration system to manage these things for you
what does this look like though?
Docker local to minikube - local Kube
Runs in Docker
Requires 3 secrets
access PostgresQL
installs composer and copys code
installs dependencies
Key Kube concepts
-Pod smallest unit you can deploy
containers in pod = to a microservice
sidecar containers, provide a service like log aggregator tooling
deployed to a namespace
-Volume - 
containers can communicate via localhost
you can scale by spinning up more Pods
-Controllers can create and manage the pods
Architecture for a sample app
What about the secrets?
Build into app image - BAD to do
Kube secrets, unencrypted - no encryption by default
install encryption and it is OK
Store in a vault built for Kube (best)
script - check her repo
minikube start
set image
once process is done, docker image in minikube ready to be deployed
kubectl create nameplace 
create secret generic
summon - app to inject keys from keyring
writing a manifest - defining the deployment
replicas: 1
pod template defined containers in pod, the config, volumes or mounted secrets, 
containers get fed env variables
exposing the app
associate it with a service
NodePort
ip
Node is an instance of a Kube cluster
in practice, most likely expose the service using a cloud provider's LoadBalancer 
minikube dashboard - very handy way to see it
and we are deployed!
examples are fun but what about real world production?
Kube at scale
manage networking between microservices
ingress/egress traffic
service meshes are new thing
system for centralized logging and monitoring of distributed apps
persistent data and security
LOT of options in the ecosystem 
maybe too many options?
lot of competing products
we are in the late early adopter phase
chasm of docs and disagreement is wide
not a lot of end user friendly docs or guides
all operations focused
CNCF has a focus to fix this
not enough end user stories
going to see a lot more people using this
YAML, there is so much YAML
sometimes have to use a straight edge
Google August 2018
AEC june 5 2018
Azure june 2018
DigitalOcean December 2018
Very strong community around k8s
Cloud Foundry
OpenShift
kubeless - k8s native serverless framework
Fission - framework for serverless functions
Even VMs on Kube
KubeVirt
Rancher
benefits to containers to remember
easy to build in a repeatable way
run isolated or network
Portable
lightweight
immutable images make quick rollback
consistent
Containers vs Serverless
both are arguably artifact packaging
lot of resources she likes - see her slides

Aquaponics system
latest thing for him is aquaponics

Test
Identifying the source
Don't just grap posts, grab it all
ID destination
What is the taxonomy
how is it expecting to store things?
Drupal migration module really helps
Field mapping
made a plan
growing veggies in winter in New Hampshire
export fields
The export from WP is XML
published by default?
understand that the way one does a thing is not the way the other will
got to factor in redirects
the README is actually a good source of data on the WP side
Docs on D8 are not there yet, (maybe we all sprint on that?)

[KEYNOTE: Itâ€™s a Great Time To Be a UX Designer](http://nerdsummit.org/#14)
[Jared Spool](https://twitter.com/jmspool)


Flattery from Kunming, china
little place
Famous for their apple stores
all fake imitation Apple stores
there are 41 apple stores just in that city
all of them are identical
in USA we have them, but it is Microsoft
Nook did same
JCPennies even wanted in on the style look/feel
Beer commercial example
2102 retail performance
average $341 per sq ft
Tiffany and Co per $3017
Apple $6050 per 
the thought
didn't mimic what had been done befoe
new thoughts about service
this is design
rendering of intent
lawsuit
apple samsung suit
apple for $1B
2 bits of evidence that Samsung had illegally copied apple
lead up of designs on the years before iPhone
then iPhone 
then trend was Samsung being more like iphone
weird bit of evidence
132 page report made by the Samsung QA department
went through all features to the iPhone
the samsung phone is broken, make it work like an iPhone
intent was clear
on one hand, cost company a bilion
other hand is someone read a QA report
Intention
innovation vs innovation
a scale
imitation route is common
Yahoo redesigned the homepage in a new design
AOL clones it
Yahoo was better design, why not?
imitation is cheaper and less risk
innovation is expensive and risky
Imitation  does not value design commodity
Innovation design heavily valued, very competitive
Business wins when it is intentionally innovative
basic idea, appropriately innovative
that innovation is where most investment needed
designers are coming up in the world
delving in further
Newspapers did fine until Craigslist
suddenly no more ad revenue or classified $ for newspapers
CL is actually very well designed
even CL is not immune and things chipped away
vacation rentals especially
AirBnB came out
financial services CC reader
Square changed everything
disruptive
Enterprise rent a car disrupted by Zipcar
(zipcar is actually a great company, love them)
Hertz and Avis have tried this, both failed
then avis bought zipcar
that underlyes the problem
on scale of im or in
bigger is not in a place to innovate 
payoff is better but risks are real
circus entertainment
cirque du soleil flipped it on its head
wider audience for street performers
dying business when they started a circus
design decision: cut animal acts from the circus
cute animals bring cute kids with cute parents with cute wallets
this reduces a lot of costs, transportation, animal care
increa performance budget
better performers, etc 
and since no kids, can raise tiket price by a lot
$120-$200 a seat
on one day Circ du Soliel makes more money than all Broadway combined
designer for hair, i <3 NY, this guy
I move things around until they look right
milton glasier
About the visual
no longer
now itis about the business that makes sense
Retail rev breakdown
Samsung vs Best Buy
40% price	50% of the price
other 10% distributor
Apple does all of it, they own all parts
for $100 they make $100
invest more in parts and quality
apple does not discount
great business models are intentially designed
designers to design buiness models are deeply needed
it is not visual, it is all aspects
Filling in gaps with Intention
would be easy to se him as an apple fanboy
owns many old versions and many new ones
not perfect
return though is actually innovative
customer journey for a defective roduct
buying
trying
return to store
wait for service
getting resolution
chart this and can see where improvements can be made
innovation does not mean what you think it means
it is not adding new inventions
apple had not been invented by Apple
added value to the experience
Inovation is adding new value
by adding a make appointment set, made a much better story since eliminate wiat for service
that is design innovation
experiences can be mapped, measured, and designed
What do we intend?
No one can make taxes delightful.
intuit 
turbotax tax app that take a pic of your W2
fills in 1040a or ez
40ish% of people file these
submit 
all in under 15 minutes
Cancer can not be delightful
but we have made improvements on the treatment of cancer
the MRI reimagined
small child, this is scary
can't move at all
they do not want to do this
sedation for 80% of kids is needed
Doug Deitz, designer of machine and watched this happen
he went to fix this
GE Adventure series
it's designed to be an adventure
Your experience is totally differnt
you get a pirate suits
also ones for your parents
and the technician has been wearing a pirate suit
plank area
water adventure
whole room designed for the senses, artwork, aromatherapy
smells like pina colada, gets the parents happy and lightens the mood
ride the pirate ship.  
flying mermaids only come out if you don't move
LEDs spin up and the mermaids appear
sedation rate dropped from 80 to 0.01%
that is the poser of degin
design for the gaps
how to we get experienced desingers to do this?
aren't enough designers
when FB bought INsta $1B
36 other photo apps in the store
even FB had one in there
they didn't want a phone app
they wanted the 13 designers 
companies bought design firms
that process continues
all kind of companies are doing it
need to to survice
21K open job listings for designers in the US
be careful what you ask for though
it is really hard to hire designers
what do they need to look for?
asked teams with great work
there are a bunch of skills
info architecture
copywriting
design process management - iterate
user research practices
interaction design
Info design
visual design
editing and curating
all of those skills hiring managers thought were needed
one more set
ethnography
domain knowledge
business knowledge
Analytics
marketing
technology
ROI
Social
Use Cases - for devs
Agile Methodology
thought they could just synthesize this
reasked some questions
what separates out the best designers?
then they gave completely new skills
storytelling
critiquing
sketching - rending an idea so people get it quickly
presenting
The rise of the UX generalist
Steven W Margles
hand and wrist doctor
best in world
local to Burlington
he fixed symphony orchestra pianist that had crushed hands
fixed pro tennis elbo
but you can get an appointment 
might take 6-8 months
up to his elbos in hands in wrists
all world renoun experts specialists
but at the hospital 9 orthededic surgens
not specialists
but over at rumsford hospital
orthodepic surgen 2 days a week
other days a general doc
deliver a baby and basic ER care
all doctors have to learn the general stuff
then he got to specialize
he still has to take course in all the general things
specialist vs generalist
compartmentalist
having expertise in only one area
they are hurting thei own careers
anyone can become a UX generalist
you can learn all the skills 
the UX designer is a unicorn 
how to become a unicorn
in 5 steps
1 train yourself
2 practice your new skills
3 deconstruct as many designs as you can
4 seek out feedback (and listen to it)
5 teach others
The Unicorn is design' most important innovation
it's a great time to be a EX designer
rendering inten
filling in the pags
generalists over specialists, compartmentalists are least valuable
Unicorns exists and you can become one

[User-Story Driven Threat Modeling](http://nerdsummit.org/#55)
[Robert Hurlbut](https://twitter.com/roberthurlbut)

Thinking about processes
he is part o
application security podcast
threat modeling is something you are already doing
but is is a thinking tool
no tool can find everything
it finds what is missed
AWS bucket checking?
Commonly we do this
thinking about security when you lock the door
thinking ahead
A conceptual exercise that aims to intensify flaws in design am modify to fix
threatmodelingbook.com
4 fundamental questions
what are we working on?
What can go wrong?
what are you going to do about it?
Did we do a good job?
his version:
a process for capturing organizing and analyzing security theats, security countermeasures, and priorities by risk
You can start any time, but early on is much better
Threat models can vary and that's OK
1. diagram/understand your system
DFDm MS SDL
external to internal how is it used
2. identify threats
ask yourself "What can go wrong?"
STRIDE
Spoofing - identity assurance
Tampering - integrity
Repudiation - receipt, proof of payment, 
Information Disclosure - confidentiality
Denial of service - availability
Elevation of privilege - least privilege
hard to fix if you get STRIDE wrong from the start
document threatsread
attack trees - slide deck Bruce Schneier
threat libraries
checklists
mitigation opos
leave as is
remove from product
remedy with tech
warn user, moving the issue to the user's problem
Document and follow up!
MS threat modeling tool
Agile/Devops?
"we don't have time for that security stuff.."
that is a decision for bad security
attackers use threat modeling
you can really do this in smaller scale and faster
STRIDE still applies
kill chain 
how to pull it all together
make it a part of your sprint
"as a <type of user> I want <some goal> for <some reason>"
abuser/attacker story
as a bad actor, I want to do bad things for bad reasons
as a hacker, I want to read the application logs
as a disgrunteled employee, I want to change pricing for some products
Be honest, leave ego at the door, no blaming!
work through your user stories
Modern approaches
incremental threat modeling
@irenemichlin
privacy getting dded to STRIDE
card games, SWASP cornucopia
Elevation of Privilege 
any time with any story
Make it fun apply in an agile way
if integrated into tests, got better view of the threats themselves

just ask a few questions on an API

[Introduction to AWS Serverless Model](http://nerdsummit.org/#29)
[Alfred Nutile](https://twitter.com/alnutile)ALFRED NUTILE

Cloud formation
AWS
stacks
it is AWS exclusive
Serverless.com
JSON/YML to built stacks
Why serverless/SAM
no servers
simple and minimal to build services
you get the all the backing of AWS
zreo downtime deployment
caching
great for batch processing
scaling built in 
why not?
Whle set of variables and issues to deal with
SAM is not secur as Serverless.com
Lickedinto AWS
Memory limits 3008 M
Runtime limites 15 minutes
Language lmitations (Java, Python, Go, NodeJS)
not 100% locally testable
AWS Pricing can be scary
he once accidently ran up a $3K bill due to deployment error
they were nive about it
you can monitor resources and keep on top of it
pricing for a lambda function is really scalable
Let's make something
Lambda
Scheduler
API
Simple Table/Dynamo/RDS
Kinesis Firehose
SQS
SNS (or S3 to SNS)
Alexa
50K people and the server is down, you don't want to deal with that
jumping into Cloud Formations
Example
Adobe analytics
not a good API
Dumped an CSV on S3
lambda ran and processes the file
100K record, every line kicks off another lambda function
not running out of resources
S3 just works
scales on it's own
step functions
giving this away OSS
simpler example
gateway app help function
3 lines of code loading from a file online and not a DB needed
.yaml
global settings
Runtime: python3.6
AWS has a lot of policies, learning what does what is a mounain of knowledge
makes it hard
Lambda foundation to a lot of this
simple function to process request
break it up into smaller peices
Lambda: CLass
he likes to write in classes, does not need to be
got to treat code like legos
template file becomes the routing
template, index or main
becomes the controller
Lambda: Controller
Deployments
yml or json
SAM does processing

[Sean Dietrich](https://twitter.com/seanedietrich)



DevOps
a lot needs to happen on a local machine
how did we get here?
Bare metal was first
local servers
hard to manage multiple versions of software
can't share
"Works on my machine" issue
VMs
shared config 
but monolithic
HUGE disk space and high memory needs
maintenance is hard
now, Containers
smaller image/faster provisioning
modular
maintainable
shareable
portable
scalable
tools and 
see pic
intall
fine tuning
start to require just Docksal
custom commands
add necessary services
automating as much as possible
one and done (fin init)
< 5 to get started
CLI!!!
fin
fin drush
fin drupal
fin composer
etc
only a piece of a puzzle
but what about port collision?
all internally handled
duping efforts
one time use software installed
1+ hours to onboard other devs
local env can be a nightmare
Docksal Sandboxes
enhanced code reviews
continuous QA
automated VRT/BDD testing
Demos
