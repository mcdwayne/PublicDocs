Texas Camp 2018: The blazing heat of Austin and learning much about Drupal core

I occasionally get on an airplane and am freezing thanks tot he AC being cranked all the way up.  This was the case when flying to [the lone star state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas) and was immediately met with

[Keynote: Breaking the Binary: The Politics of Code and Inclusivity in Technology](https://2018.texascamp.org/happenings/keynote-breaking-the-binary-the-politics-of-code-and-inclusivity-in-technology)
[Nikki Stevens](https://twitter.com/drnikki)

Great intro from [Michael Schmid](https://twitter.com/Schnitzel)

Are things the way they are now, the way they have to be?
No
binary does not change for instance
code does not change
but we used to have balanced terniary system
nothing is inevitable or unchangeable
can we image a different future?
Politics 
definitions from the crowd
slow
messy
intersection of change
manipulative
power is exchanged
tech work is political
algorithm to tell who on skid row on who gets a house
it affects real things
internet exists in the real world
interent is just tubes filled with cats
we forget that this is computers made with stuff from mines
in a system, we are all connected
do small choices matter? yes
vim vs emacs
trello vs jira
vagrant vs lando
all the choices matter
the foundation for inclusion is the abiity to imagine new futures
no one knows how tech works in general populations
does you 'user' exist
average pilot issue
Open demographics began last year
gender: male/female/other
open-demographics on github
gender form to many more options
small choice, huge difference
distributed credit shatters illusions of meritocracy by showing all the labor involved
supported by charts that show 86% male in the space
reinfocing illusions in the system
What's the business case?
Diverse companies do better and make more money
changing ideas about women
why are we still here?
what is the business case for not changing our hiring practices
data show this is import to change
what systems are we supporting with our corporate and 
why are black women so
things designed for white faces/skin
not taking things like gender diversity in stats
tech is important and impacts the world

[Getting closer to your customer: Using Drupal in the last mile](https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/getting-closer-to-your-customer-using-drupal-in-the-last-mile)
[Kelly Albrecht](https://twitter.com/KSAlbrecht)

Why we are thinking this way and how to implement
How close are you to your customers now?
easy to push customers away if you see them as interruptions
lot of misconceptions of what DevOps is
people think about it terms of servers and machine
DevOps camoe from the developer and the operations folks not communicating
shortening the feedback loop and adding value to chain
customer benefits
break down the wall of confusion
automation helps
feedback though is critical
narrow version of this topic and that is ok, we talk about it a lot
want to automate to noops (no ops)
this is short sighted
Whole point is delivering someting of value to the customer
think about getting everyone in loop to customer as communicative as possible
Dev, Test, Engineers to get to mind set
build,CI,Deploy,Operate,feedback,plan,build loop
manager / maker schedule
feedback comes in as tickets
that is what the devs thought
needs to think wider with it
apply flow and automation ot customer feedback as well
which new thing is more important than the other new thing
what's new, what is, how is it?, what's next
people lose faith based on how they misunderstand a product
WP as a community thinks about the end customer a lot more than Drupal generally does
What if we modified the Drupal login experience 
Tour is un D8 core, not being promoted but very valueable
`?tour` trigger tour trick popup
demo
end user feedback at the end of a tour
get feedback quiz
if people feel their feedback would be heard, they give it
We need everyone's perspective to make our product as intuative as possible
keep experimentations simple and cheap, 
iterate to get closer to you

[a11y -- ARIA Rules: To Use Or Not To Use](https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/a11y--aria-rules-to-use-or-not-to-use)
[Susan LaRonde]()
[Charles Leverington](https://twitter.com/c_leverington)


Speaker notes are available on the slides from link
examples of ARIA accessable approved code are freely examples
purpose
add functionality where semantic HTML does not
classes and how they relate
HTTML DOM tree JS Accessibility tree Assistive technology user
right click inspect, look at JS events, look for accessibility tree 
only exists since 2012
most roles are automatically made in HTML5, leveraging semantic HTML
roll = navigation
no aria is better than bad ARIA
do not overwrite existing accessibility semantics
do not change the native semantics unless you have to
ARIA uses KISS principal
lot of code examples in this talk that ironically I had to strain to see from even my third row seat
third rule of ARIA, always make sure keyboard controls are usable
NVDA - NVAccess, free and open source

[The traffic fallacy](https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/the-traffic-fallacy)
[Sean Eddings](https://twitter.com/LastCallMedia)

lives in NYC
traffic is bad and many places are too
but thinking while stuck in traffic
not a ton of thought given to solving
he researched and Houston to Katyland TX
41 minutes to go 28 miles on average
right now, hour and 20 minutes
in 2004 nonprofit said 25million hours wasted
delay would double by 2025
about $503,620,000 lost opportunity per year
engineers, extra lanes means more capacity
Texas spent $2.8 billion to widen the Katy Freeway
average time increased from 41 min to 64 minutes
55% increase
the amount of freeway increased the number of cars increased, ratio remained the same and actually worsened
50 lane freeway in hong kong
freeway engineers have the best intentions
Need a vehicle and progress limit
Manhatten is experiment with congestion pricing
no go on this idea now
Stockhom, Sweden, bunch of islands
set up experiment, costs a $1 to enter central city
when people saw the data after 6 months
travel time decreased by 50%
emissions dropped by 14-18% in inner city
what about our industry
Backlogs are like this, things taking forever never get done
think, more people, get done faster
looked at tast list and too many things assigned to single contributors
Value was taking too long to get to the customer, and everyone was too busy
looked at they way they managed processes
realized they had a command and control model
traditional management says 100% utilization of people was the key
but if everyone is busy, delivering value with predictability is not impossible
changed to prioritized delivering work to the customer as quickly as possible
goal: put our good ideas into action quickly
1. Visualize our process
2. limit our work in progress
3. improve as a team
1. visualized
moved away from tech, went to boards and paper
high level visibility for team
bottlenecks easier to see, respect or change
makes hidden work apparent
2. limit work in progress
how many things can you really work on?
excessive WIP heightens distractions
marked WIP limits on board
there is no right WIP limit for everyone
a lower WIP is generally better
a too high WP leaves work idle
too low leaves people ide
WIP limits are not rules
take a list of work, prioritize it based on biz value
that is your backlog
work top to bottom
right now thinking of tasks and breaking them in different ways so something is completed
task that needs approval example, 
deliverable is the thing to be evaluated but that is a new card once feedback is given
conversation the team has on who does what
always keep things in motion though to get to value delivered
flow efficiency is the sum of value adding activities in relation to the throughput time
Flow Efficiency = Value Adding Activities/throughput time
Works because devs do not put things in To Do
selected for dev is a parking lot
ready to deploy is a staging area
what stayed the same?
Multifunctional team
dedicated team
queue hygiene
daily stand ups
retros
what changed
optimizing for getting a single work unit through the process as quickly as possible
ea members attached to work
team members pull work
that takes a lot of autonomy
Good to Great teams:
set the stage
gather data
generate insights
decide what to do
clone the retro
What did we learn?
Start with what we have
prioritize our work
visualize our process
limit WIP
Retros are how team improves
goal is to deliver value faster to customer
Agile and Lean, are all about experimentation and learning.  Enjoy the trip

##### Keynote Saturday

[Keynote: The Future of Drupal](https://2018.texascamp.org/happenings/keynote-the-future-of-drupal)
[Michael Schmid](https://twitter.com/Schnitzel)

We need to talk Drupal
You taught us a lot Drupal
collaboration
parties
speaking
growing companies
You have changed lives
but you also changed a lot
Drupal 8 is not the old Drupal
Upgrading from D7->D8 is really hard
Modules work differently
OOP everywhere, you have to understand deeply
so many new things to learn
and already Drupal 9 is in discussion
Adoption is slowed down and it is scary
same is true for DrupalCon attendees
no DCon Europe
You also created physical and mental pain
Drupal Confessions
didn't do his due diligence and found out too late
He is sorry for what happened
it is gone now, but caused a lot of pain he sees now
Had to learn composer and the CLI
so complex now
and now need to learn JavaScript
and it is very different too
and now the Security Issues
so many hours
is Drupal over?  
is that our tomorrow?
NO! it is not over
Who is Drupal?
If we blame Drupal, we are blaming ourselves
we are all in there together
The others are not sleeping
Drupal is already powering the web
we have a lead
over a million sites
5% of top Million websites are drupal
181 governments use Drupal for sites
So many governments decided to use this code we make
Want to buy a car, you are likely using Drupal sites
Lush - Drupal commerce, but because of our code
NBC, Pfizer, etc
Drupal is used more and more by bog and important websites
is more market share really better?
D.O Data Usage is voluntary
many people disable the ping back to Drupal
Now we have a roadmap!
we have a plan for next
an upgrade path
D9 Upgrade path, as easy as 8.0 to 8,1
will be smooth process
Camps are happening and getting more and more important
Camps are less intimidating than Cons
Camps are closer to the people
and much more affordable
only works if businesses sponsor
It is hard since 'what do I get back'
small $ back, sure
but you are making Drupal better and possible
and send employees to participate and bring community closer
should be sharing that knowledge internally
lunch and learn it, share what you loved
employees: ask to go to camps
All the major frameworks using Symfony framework
Drupal started that
added complexity, but akes us all stronger
why embracing and using other tools
We have always done it, like jquery
Less overall work
brings us closer to the rest of the PHP world
easier to hire engineers
Composer
We need package managers
there is no other way
everybody uses it
everyone has always used package managers 
like driving a car
it seems impossible at first
Secure is much more transparent
Drupal Security is completely volunteers
Same processes like Linux, Google, Apple, etc
hosting companies have you covered
JavaScript?
Most popular tools, tops the list
TensonFlow, React
Stanford intro CS is in JS
Decoupled frameworks
this is how most large sites work now
API first is key
MOre dev, design, UX capabilities
So Drupal, forefront of decoupling
Full support for JSON-API and GraphQL
Contenta CMS
Angular, Elm, Ember, React, Vue
still a hard problem, but this is getting easier
So Dear Drupal
Lets build the future
Accept and embrace change from all of us
we alwaus making it better
but that takes investment from us all
and if we believe

[Hmm, I Didn’t know that Module Existed!](https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/hmm-i-didnt-know-that-module-existed)
[Fito Kahn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fitokahn/)

Drupal?!?!  
What have I gotten myself into?
Fear!  
Some people on first site right now
Overwhelming at first
but there is hope
there are so many modules
and the Joy of D8 being awesome
History of D8 75 core modules in D8
not as many contrib modules needed
30 core in D7
important dates
3982 D8 modules in 2018
8641 D7 Modules 
Experimental Models as well
many in core are turned off, just need activated,
Modules that will make life better
- Admin Toolbar/Tool Bar Extra
- Coffee and Coffee Extras - search in admin that is easy to use
- Pathauto - makes URLs with tokens easy
- SEO Checklist 0 
- Content Moseration/Workflows - in core! 
- multilingual support, content translation in Core - 4 modules
- Webform - you can design your own
- Simple Sitemap - lighter than XML sitemap
- Slick/Slick Extras - one of many solutions for slideshows/carousel
can be touch to configure
- Focal Point - crop API
- Honeypot - defer spam bots from completing forms, not as intrusive as captcha
- Autoban (Automatic IP ban) using watchdog table
- Scheduler
- Paragraphs - editors control flow of content - replaces bidy field with content types you can mix and match
- Views Reference - field conjunction with paragraphs, adds more flexibility
- Panels/Panelizer/Display suite - create drag and drop layouts for customize looks of site
Let's remember this is all to avoid actually touching code
this is all just install and config, very different than hand changing views
- settings tray - core.  Customizer for Drupal
- Bricks
- String overrides 
- Statistics - in core - can slow down the site but valuable info
- Module filter
- Alexa - yeas integrate Alexa with a D8 site

[Archiving and Visual Regression Using Drupal 8](https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/archiving-and-visual-regression-using-drupal-8)
[David Stinemetze](https://twitter.com/DavidStinemetze)


Why?  Old parts fo site don't change
testing anyway
add on a wayback machine element
Module overview
Web Page Archive module snap local or remote, triggered periodically, compare snapsops based on URL or XML sitemaps
Snapshops can be captured on any site
not just current instance, not just drupal, not just sites you own
Requirements, D8
Why?
Learn D8, Ease of use for non-tech users
Drupal 8 plugin ecosystem makes it easy to support additional use cases
give back to the Drupal community
Capture Utilities
Drupal plugins responsible for performing captures
uses annotation based discovery
configurable per instance
Captures screenshots of URLs
uses Headless chrome and puppetier
examples
can also capture raw HTML
Skeleton Capture, prototyping tool
Web Page Test Capture Utility
Captures web performance test results
just capturing it now
other proposed use cases 
Configuration Archive Capture
Rendered DOM capture
Google Analytics Capture
Security Scan Utility
can configure easily with dropdowns
don't want to manually capture each page, use site map
capture stores things, storage can be an issue
Current Project Sessions - yesterday Spot the Difference tool
Visual Regression is all about the things human eyes easily overlook
slider compare
compare screenshots Heatmap
bright red to highlight differences
Release plan drupal.org/node/2930857
Some remaining issues
You can help
needs new code, needs reviews, etc
demo time
in config, website archive tab

[Goldilocks Decoupled: What the Future Holds for Decoupled Publishing](https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/goldilocks-decoupled-what-the-future-holds-for-decoupled-publishing)
[Mike Minecki](https://twitter.com/mirzu)


This is not a demo or a show and tell
why Devs love Decoupled
Hard choices
are you doing stand alone or hub
chart for this out there
simplifies the ideas of it
if there are other apps basically
heart of the chart is layout and display managment
modules, toolbar notifications, caching and performance
end up with choices
coupled, progressive, fully decoupled
more JS -->
Why do Devs love it?
bad reasons
new and shiny, Drupal is hard, performance, Dogfood API
Why good
good reasons
Shared templates and language
building frontend in JS is really fast and rather easy
Static site generators are really performance
seperation of concerns
a lot more to a website than static markup and content
Content routing and complexity for instance
Decoupled pitfalls
Snowflakes - every front end unique
can't install stuff (like twitter cards or sitemap.xml)
caching and routing - static site generatos don't work for bigger sites
Progressive Decoupled - the middle way
Cons
Reheaded stepchild of the monoloth and JS framworks
need deep understanding of both to build new stuff
DX is only great if 2 teams
Tons of Content APIs
0 ways to render them without a dev
44 decoupled backend listed on headlesscms.org
that's weird
off the reservation  - Arc publishing
a pagebuilder
Superdesk publisher
lightweight source renderer
Goldilocks
benefits for devs
100%JS
Declaritive
Editorial contrils
Built to work with reverse proxies
Stanradized workflows

how to fall asleep
4 7 8 breathing

8 seconds you breath out
counting down from 100 to 0
