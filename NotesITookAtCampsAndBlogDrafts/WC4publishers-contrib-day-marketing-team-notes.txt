pericson is a shop manager and agreed to do an Agency case study and began that process through the survey links.  


Discussions:
Plugins - like the Admin WordPress Events and News plugin. 
Or why can't we push out materials there like wptavern does?

Speaking of news.  Can we get marketing initiatives listed here: https://wordpress.org/news/

Newsletter.  
We need one.  Let people opt in for updates in their email?  Can they subscribe outside of joining marketing channel.  That was all that was discussed.
