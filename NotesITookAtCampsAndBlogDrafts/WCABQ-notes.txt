Cain & Obenland In The Morning 
Konstantin Obenland, Michael Cain

Came in late
Mendel Kurland special guest
Just a fun time
interview poked some loving fun at Mendel
Q- how has gosaddy been adapting to be better at WP
A - Aaron campbel hire, sending employees better in the community
intensley important ways, hiring contributors, and be with the community
level up the community
A lot of small companies do business with small dev shops, decided to important to support that group of devs, make their experience better, that is GoDaddy Pro
global sponsor as well
Been to over 100 camps
Q-advice for new campers
A-keep yourself open to conversations and learning, asssume everyone else is open to this as well
Q-favorite parts of WC
A-until now, the cain and oberland show, but being a guest is terrifying
Plug for camp.press
Last section
Gutenberg
less than 1/3 of room had heard of it
New Core Default Editor in 5.0
JS based editor
Blocks, and blocks, and blocks
unify all the various contents into blocks
true WYSIWYG
lot of bugs now, but working out
no more post types, widgets, etc
One thing differnt than short codes- blocks can have prompts, no longer have to fully know how to use, prompts guide now
Does the dirty work for you
lot of default vlocks but many more being built
one day will get rid of sidebar and widgets and shortcodes
custom functionality from plugins
Gutes demo
pre-gutes theme? 
works out of the box but not fully using it prperly though
New themes will be more and more thmes to leverage this soon

[Using Arrays as Plugin Variables â€¦ Or Why I Should Patch Core]() 
[Brian Stinar](https://en.gravatar.com/brianstinar)

Created a site from a form
how did this happen
custom code in there too
lots of boilerplate approach?
lot of deisions and cluncky
used 100% JS to invoke enque hooks
super fast and reliable
Code under GitHub
100% Gravity Forms dependent right now
could hook in others

Student of change

Gave us all his cell # to text him questions throughout the event
People are not ready to change until there is provable reason to make things better
Give space for emotion
why are Automattic folks amming clever "cheshire wapuu" shirts?
Need an emotional tie in to the community and people
Mind the mobile
one big issue, stuck int he desktop world
trying to solve mobile issues from the desktop, everyone is mainly using phones
The net used to be super locked down
confined and complex
First militay
then acedemia
in 2008
when smartphones got traction then everyone had access to that information network
devs trying to free this network stack
no single mind could understand, but the chaos was interesting
one MIT network was in fact called Chaos Network 
it will continue to be decentralized and complex
anything around for a long while, you get tech debt
London water system losed 40% along the way
Internet is different
Cathedral and the Bazaar 
why did linux win, why did open source win
because it is too complex to understand as a single person, but as a group, we can make it together
WP is canonical dev approaches to SW
people that fill in that gap make it all work because we are working with everyone's best interest in mind
Bazaar is messy and emergent
Cathedral is top down and controlled
companies firmly believe in the cathedral, boss's boss oks changes
before 2008 not as many computers, because of smart phones, everyone gets access
bazaar makes most sense, the experience gets better faster
solving end user problems not just dev and intended specific user problems
Design by committee has issues and compromise
realizing that you have to be good for specific sagments and do that instead of everyone really
Theory: Google is really, really good design
WP used to be the best at design
we need to reawaken that potential
WordPress will be Good Design For All
working on how to make this happen as a community
Why? The parts are good
VR and Voice are already usable with WP
already there, programming by alexa voice commands possible
devs love new technology
Issue is sometimes we are not solving for tomorrow, just today
AARP realized years ago that the way people aging and how old they were getting changed
We need human "wow"!
how does Open Web survive? Needs to for all freedom for all
lot of things were not designed for people, but for technologists
how to improve? Project Muriel..
how to make products more inclusive and emotional and delightful but data driven
best practice standards for using in your cathedral approach projects
SWOT
lets just talk SW
Strength Weakness Hard to know who to design for

We should ask what end users need, nobody thinks that is a bad idea
implementing that is hard
Sometimes government gets it right
how important precedent is, huge thing
policy precedent is an interesting thing, listen to your constituents
how policy is shaped
why not how policy is communicated
cultural changes are hard
How important is listneing for inclusion
super important
must discover and create space for it, hard in a democracy
wethepeople platform took a lot of discovery
Base foundation is listening and intentionally allowing people to share
People already paying attention are already there
want to bring in other voices
Issue with "won't Fix" status
makes it less inclusive in WP
non-accepted code submissions make it geel isolated and not growing community
need to get out of the internal bubble mindset
always a learning curve, how to we manage that
Why WordPress and Automattic?
Based on the time of recognizing tech community importance
democratizing to give people better voice
need people sharing voices and engaging in new dialog
can't guarantee that people wil stick arond, need tools to bring in new people
any change happens from community driven
lot of commonality with the way people think about it
better civic dialog inside 
need to do this accross the internet, communities,
that is why WP is important, 29% and growing
What did you take away from your experience in design school?
can't grow if you don't learn
must have mechanisms to hold lessons dear and learn from them
Tips on doing more reflection:
Document along the way no matter how informal
think about why you are doing thing and answer these questions in docs
as you learn and adjust and get new data, you can better track momentum
at first feels silly, but over time pays off huge
Makes teams more focused and when new ideas come through you can better vet them
COmmunity and conversations are a big deal
one of the ways they started to battle pay discrimination was try9ing to shift the firewall of people discussing compensation
Having open dialogs are the key to so many things
