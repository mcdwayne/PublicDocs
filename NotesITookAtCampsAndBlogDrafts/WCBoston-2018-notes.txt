[Keynote: The Gutenberg Journey](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/keynote/)
[Tammie Lister](https://twitter.com/karmatosed)

easy to get started but
harder to learn fully
the WP Way is not always what we want
we deal with it and work around
is coping really the way?
It all started out with just words
was a flat way
now we want to publish rich content
Blur of White story
pre-gutenberg
truly tells story 
should be very easy
Plugins 
we are too reliant on many 
held together with hope and tetris
creating amazing work but hacking around blockades
this happens to all software
a rethink is needed from time to time
WP was unchallenged for the longest time
new planets being discovered in the publishing universe
not only the obvious choice anymore
squarespace, wix, etc biting at the heels
not self hosted but orbitting and pulling in users
people don't want the hassle of caring for their own WP
Gutes is not a miricle cure
but it is a step to push us into the future
the foundations are the packaging
Thinking in parts and patterns
components - humas are great at this
principles are the same, all pattern recognition
Block by Block HTML editing prevents breaking whole post
safe container for content
once you understand how to use one block, know how to use all the blocks
Placeholders are very critical to the system
prompts to engage with the block
interactive
this allows for Templating
less confusing experience than what is right now
true WYSIWYG path
direct manipulation
change it, you see it
we expect this now actually, we are super use to seeing this due to apps
touch devices trained us to think this way
we have need based options
if want to eat soup, don't need a utility tool with lots of options
bad experience leads to trust problems
just doing what is needed is primary to the experience Gutenberg is striving for
expected options
not kitchen sink, just what most users will expect
Safe exploration of new options, good for learning
the delight is what we want with Gutes
WP right now is people just coping
move on path to people thriving with the experience
accesible experience is good for everyone
key to this project
tips - welcome guide
the little nudges are helping educate 
editor needs to work across any device
mobile or apps are essential
performance is even more important on mobile
WP can be moulded to the experience you want it to be
extending the CMS is very key
Gutenberg makes this more accessible
The Journey
3 phases
1. Editor - the one we are in right now
has taken longer due to the need to rebuild foundational level tings
2. Customization - more page builders - templating
3. Theme - not really determined
going to be a really exciting time as we get further along
most stats only show what has happend 
v1.0 8/29/17 
been 30+ releases
3, 128 closed issues
3,861 PRs closed
8/6/18 v3.2 - feature complete
bug fix and iteration now
Travelers
teams all across the web have joined this journey
Many folks have shaped the direction of the project
atomicblocks.com - new theme, set of blocks and plugins
even on its own its a great Gutes theme
testing and feedback been in the heart of the project
many different resources
booths and user testing
helping guide the 
10up.com/blog/user-testing-gutenberg
the path ahead
lot more work left for sure
-4.9.8 Try Gutenberg Callout 
-Feedback and iteration - all the wider feedback
stress cases expected
-Ready to get into core
alpha and beta releases
-5.0 - the thing all this phase is leading to
then start the next phase
a busy time for everyone in WP
The Future
personal views, not necessarily facts
the theme elephant needs to be dealt with
we will see more of a shift to styleguides
maybe config files but not a lot more in themes
where editor and customizer start/stop will blend
themes create good boundaries 
Gutenberg will get us t where we should ave gotten by now
come join the journey

[Blobs, Chunks, and Blocks: Structured Content in the Age of Gutenberg](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/blobs-chunks-and-blocks-structured-content-in-the-age-of-gutenberg/)
[John Eckman](https://twitter.com/jeckman)

Interested in the concept of structured content
lot of great opp
We've been here before
Blobs
presentational logic and structure in one blob
makes reuse difficult, 
but faster to create
Chuncks 
content broken into small structures components
seperate prsentation and structure
facilitate reuse
more planning needed to execute
in 2013, he argued WP is blobby but can be made chunky with ACF and such
enter the Gutes
blocks are making it easier to edit content
but is it making us more blobby or chuncky
mixed
can get us to easier to develop and use
and preserve structured content
looking into code
it is better than blobs of html we had before
some structured
hypothetical case study
metadata vs Data
Meta - Album- artist
-title
-Review - authoer
-date
-score
preGutes
WYSIWYG editr in content
Very blobby
no reuse
Not Much consistancy
very fast and simple
don't do this
if doind a one off post, not a bad idea though, bad for a site
round B - could shortcode to insert Album
structures the data slightly
use shortcode ui
still pretty blobby
hard to access data inside the shortcode
hard to track relationship of shortcode to posts using it
better way to do this, 
review CPT with specific post meta and taxonomy
tempate for CPT
more consistency 
but what about Multiple albums in a review
in print this is just there - review can account for multiple albums
Round 3 (pre-gutes)
Review and Album CPT w/relationship
artist or label as CPT or Taxonomy
enables reuse: Show other albums by this artist
Editing is more complex, create album first then review it is mandatory here
Enter the Gutenberg
Round1 
custom blocks for albums
editors can but it anywhere
but inconsistent
but no reuse
Better than the old blobby way?
round 2
Reviews CPT and Block template
consistent layout
some reuse of sections
round 2b reusable, shared, saved blocks for albums
Underneath the hood, saved blocks are just CPT with clock content
not easy to see if they exist already
still pretty blobby
Round 3
reviews and albumbs as CPT
Album CPT could still use a block template
set taxonomies on review based on Album CPT pull 
decent reuse


round 4
Reviews and albus as CPT
if Album does not exist, create it
set taxon and relationships on album save enable editing a a blovk 
Goal:
Get the editing expereince of a blobby system where you edit the things you wwant
preserve the structured data to beable to reuse it
Why does it matter?
Future proofing
what happens when new devices get introduced and necessitates differnt combos of output
New features
consistancy
single record for each object
Enable relationships
show other albums by this artist
show other albumbs by category
show other reviews of the a
Conclusions
block based editing can improve the experience
closer to WYSIWYG
more flexibility to ove things around
Block based editing can make WP blobbly
proper content modeling and planning are required

[The Basics of building a Gutenberg Block](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/the-basics-of-building-a-gutenberg-block/)
[Amanda Giles](https://twitter.com/AmandaGilesNH)

Gutes history
Anatomy of a block
comes with standard blocks
save and reuse blocks
it will soon appear
plugin now
WP 5.0
4.9.8 callout
classic editor plugin
transition
write your own blocks
almost entirely in JS
PHP is just to bring in files
abstraction layer over React
ES% or newer
ES5 2009
ES6 2015
ES8 is the current
they want a release a year
ESNext is the currently being worked on version
JSX is another compoent, JS XML-like syntax
needs a package manager
node, webpack, etc,
Many Gutes Block tutorial use JSX, but not all
this demo is in ES5
no build step needed
syntax differences
example code
Gutes handbook shows ES5 and ESNext
build a CTA in Gutenberg
block, background, button, etc
on the backend, in admin, 
5 steps to building a plugin
1create plugin main file
2register backend editor JS, CSS
3register frontend CSS, JS if dynamic
4in PHP:Register block type using register_blovk_typle()
5 n hooked JD file, call block in editor
steps 2,3 and 4 happen all together
tagged to the init hook
before we get into JS part
comes with JS libraries as globals
wp.blocks
wp.editor
wp.element
wp.components
wp.i18n
wp.date
others too
registerBlockType()
single JS call containing our complete block code
General info about the block including title, icon, category, keywords
code samples code samples
many resources presented at the end

[Use Your WordPress Powers for Good](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/use-your-wordpress-powers-for-good/)
[Michelle Ames](https://twitter.com/michelleames)


We have all made bad websites
bad clients
made a little money
but we have fun
but we can do more
we can mentor people
introducing people to WP
giving them advice
that is how Michelle learned
this is what she taught her daughter's friend
later hired her
maybe can't mentor
teach classes
nothing to a bad website
why are you teaching other people, are they not competition
nope, internet too vast
she has never been in the same bid as anyone she knows
charge more and teach people
hold a clinic
basically happiness bar you are running yourself
teaching some basics, sometimes they decide they just need to hire someone
like her 
one a month Co-Working
just work on won stuff in the same room
gives you a set of resources and not working alone
exchange ideas
Teach someone like someone taught you
Speak up at a meetup
speak at a meetup
got hacked, fixed it, hacked again, learned why, fixed it right
tells this at meetups
organize a meetup
pay it forward
Pay it back to WP
participate in the forums
you likely know the answers to some of the questions
help with videos
can share around even if not as good as WP.tv quality
Help organize or volunteer at a WordCamp - the real heros of WordCamps
wranglers
Help out at the Happiness Bar
You can just show up and help
she had imposter syndrome 
quickly gave way when first person asked about CSS 
Participate in a hackathon
What else we get from giving back?
Friends!
we get clients from it!
new jobs!
warm fuzzies
getting started:
meetup
WordCamp
go to co-working
participate in WP Forums
help someone else
tweet 
ask

[Subscription and Membership Based Income using WooCommerce](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/subscription-and-membership-based-income-using-woocommerce/)
[Ross Viviano]()


Recurring vs one time payments
why?
more predictable revenue stream
some clients think easier to match their needs and expectations
one time payment system is scarier
what is needed
WooCommerce!
do need a payment gateway
Stripe or PayPal
paid Woo plugin called Subscriptions
Prospress
payment gateways are not all created easily, needs to have subscriptions built into it
25 officially supported one
Prospress has great docs to add to a plugin
as a personal note, important to have multiple gateways
install and setups
Simple Subscriptions
price
expire after
sign up
free trial - adds time to total expire after
sale price
default subscriptions
viable subscriptions
similar to variable products
add atributes to that subscription
recurring donations for a nonprofit
1 month-6 month-yearly
create variations from attributes
that makes 3 different subscription products
editing monthly subscription, drop downs
multiple variations possible
the possibilities are very extensive
customers can change per
if customer has more control inspires more confidence
status of the subscription and sub number and other meta
was as bulk editor view
lot of control over this screen
subscription details page
customer subscription status
everything can be customized
new email types
4 new coupon types that come with subscriptions
good for rewarding customers
Allow switching subscriptions
go from one plan to the other without resignup
simple subscription 
recurring, varying periods
full signup fee when switching
like shipping use case
Memberships is another plugin
by SkyVerge
other plugins for this, but these are the 2 best
why is this needed, if using Subscriptions, you don't
but can restrict content on site based on groupings
Groups plugin is interesting too
length based memberships
posts category tags
pricing tiers tied to membership
import/export csv - push to email marketing tools
memberships and subscriptions integrations
subscriptions enable recurring billing
team them up and you can grant access to content based on subscription level
able to use a free trial period
memberships supports that upgrade/downgrade model
only members of the pla
example product: Meatball Pizza Bowl from Olive Garden
manage section shows details of subscription 
if accessing pages not in subscriptions, no access
remember everything is a post, order number and sub number can't be the same
every order is a post essentially
there are plugins to get sequential 
-Subscribe All The Things
can add subscription options to non-subscription type options
product bundles, mix and match bundles
subscribe to a cart before checkout
-Follow Ups
-WooCommerce Subscription Downloads
Teams for WooCommerce memberships

[(Slightly) Advanced Topics In Block Development](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/slightly-advanced-topics-in-block-development/)
[Josh Pollock](https://twitter.com/Josh412)


How do we 
yes this is complex to learn
but it solves so much
should  npm/yarn/etc?
pros
deendency management
consistency
automation
sanity is restores
cons
node_module get big
webpack
takes code and make it into browser safe
pros
full featurd builder
helps get your files compiles and bundles
can transpile latest JS(babel) and anything else
aslo for CSS
cons
hard to learn
fast moving eco-system
ESNext
proc
cont, let, arrow, 
fethc
async
cons
--
--
every block is becoming own packages
npm i @wordpress/element
using react right now
all this stuff is put on wp Global
wp.element
don't have to build my own
if you enqueue these things can do on admin
or can nom install all these packages
you want core to lead things on the page, have to tell webpack not to bundle this on screen
in a WP plugin npm i -D @wordpress/name
in React App?  npm @wordpress/name
the webpack alias is used in Gutenberg core code
Using Jest and Enzyme
component testing
Snapshot testing
DOM testing
a11y testing
compares functionality snapshots to let you know when it breaks
JSX
yes
easiest way into react
Scaffolding tools for Blocks
npx...whatever
"I sort of understand webpack.  That's probably enough"
wp-cli scaffold 
wp scaffold plugin movies
wp scaffold block movie --tile="Movie Block"
on github:
Create Guten Block
GutenBlock
react-wp-scripts
hot module replacement
Composing blocks
creating blocks out of modular components
modular building blocks - thinking in react
more usable and more testable, only one concern
using WP state management
Example Checkbox Controls
Passing data back up
Inspector Controls
onChange

[Hiding the Pulleys and Strings](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/hiding-the-pulleys-and-strings/)
[Jesse Friedman](https://twitter.com/professor)

Personalization is not one thing
lady brought in a giant iMac into a starbucks
a reorder button is not cusimization
predictive analytics and tracking and predicting actions is key
everyone thinks only the big companies are doing
who is visiting your site
what is their intent
Not everyone is there to purchase that product
don't tie me to the thing I bought, it might not be for me
Goals os a blog
subscribe and comment
share and stay
Albuquerque journal case study
increased ingagement just by turning on related posts
Jetpack made this simple and automatic, reduced server load actually
Back to blog example
what pages visited
did they scroll all the way dow ( mark posts as read)
did they do a search?
did they click any links  (categories or tag)?
did they share?
did they comment?
let's take the subscribe button and change it to something perosnal
grab the category name and sub it in to what page they landed on for subscribe button
understand the patht he user has taken
every tag has it's own RSS feed
you can subscribe to any extra feeds at all
/tag/wordpress/feed/
add feed auto on comment forms, lets you reach back out easier
email follow up with commenters
akismet + manual looking at data lets you control this easier
thanks them, recap their visit 
give them back quick share links
customized search page
cusomized 404 search page
Goals
bring in customers
call or Directions
make a reservation
they are there for hours, directions, menus, specials, reservations
just want to get in and out of the site and server the data fast
goal should not be to have time on the site
Boston restaurant Pap Razzi
he just cared anbout up to date
but let's look at 2 usrs
1 is 500+ miles away while closed
2 is 10 minutes away from a location during business hours
we should think of them differently with different goals
level of intent
proximity coupons
Ecommerce sites
search is key
Google actually handles most search actually overall
nice prompt if repeated visits to a type of page
cart abandonment is an area we are focused on a lot in this market
coupon codes are popular now
no one uses this trick: in the email is a cookie
you can track open rates
if you tie a cookie to expiration date you cna better understand intent
you can tie that to a campaign to fire off another email
2nd 2nd chances
Don't lose out becaue you think
