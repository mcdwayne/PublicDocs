WordCamp Boston 2018: Summer is wonderful in Boston and teaching people Git is awesome

For the 2nd time in 3 weeks I got to go to ["The Athens of America
"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_nicknames) and got to go there in perhaps the best time of year to go.  This time around I was met with very pleasant temperatures and pleasantly surprising light traffic.  The city was kind enough to reroute some predicted thunderstorms for us as well, though it did allow a little rain to get through.  The people were in full summer celebration mode this time around and it was a joy to be around so many cheerful folks in general.  It made for a great [WordCamp Boston 2018!](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/schedule/)

### Food and Fun

Pre-camp WP friends dinner

This is one of the fee camps that I go to that does not do their speaker dinner on the night before the camp kicks off.  In fact they don't do a speaker dinner at all, they do a brunch for us, more on that later.  This left me an evening on my own, which I will admit has the potential to be a lonely time.  Very fortunately for me, one of the most thoughtful folks I am proud to call friend [Mike Demo](https://twitter.com/mpmike/status/1021173296598011904) did some groundwork and invited a number of us campers together to a dietary restriction friendly joint near the harbor and only a few minute walk from the old part of town, [Warehouse Bar & Grille](http://thewarehouseboston.com/).  A few of us found our way to a few of the [oldest bars in the United States](https://www.thrillist.com/drink/boston/union-oyster-house-jacob-wirth-amrheins-are-some-of-the-oldest-bars-in-boston) where we were treated to some amazing covers by the 'Best event band in Boston' [The Sweet Beats](http://thesweetbeatsband.com).  It was a wonderful kickoff for a wonderful weekend.

##### Day 1

Coffee was Starbucks, which always tastes burnt to me when served from a [Cambro](http://www.amazingeventrentals.com/product/cambro-beverage-dispenser-brown/).  Fortunately they had some solid tea choices as well for my caffeine fix.  While en general trying to reduce carb intake, the sesame bagels, one of many pastry and fruit options present, called out to me.  It was a pretty good fuel for a very busy morning of setup, greetings and Happiness Bar fun. 

Lunch was a bag lunch. I had a pretty tasty and spicy red pepper hummus wrap from the university catering with some chips and an apple.  No tweets I can find show the camp eating together in the big auditorium where it was served, but it was a beautiful sight.  Instead here is a tweet that features one of our afternoon snack options.

##### After Party

As in the previous year's event, which I was also [lucky enough to attend](https://www.mcdwayne.com/2017/07/24/wcbos-2017/), we adjourned immediately after the last session down the road to the [White Horse Tavern](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60745-d1008274-Reviews-White_Horse_Tavern-Boston_Massachusetts.html).  Having limited plant based options I did a quick side trip with fellow herbivore and local history expert [John Eckman](https://twitter.com/jeckman) down a few blocks to [Whole Heart Provisions](https://www.wholeheartprovisions.com/). The place knocked my socks off with their inventive flavor profiles and killer (but kind to animals) crispy brussel sprouts.  Back at the White Horse, we got to enjoy a summer evening out on their back patio and even indulge in a few rounds of corn hole, which just so happened to feature [Rachel Cherry's](https://twitter.com/bamadesigner) favorite football team.  

https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/1020807111209410560

##### WCKaraoke

Not only did we go back to [Limelight Stage and Studios][http://www.limelightboston.com/] for some karaoke fun, but we got to see some of our favorite local regulars while there.  For some folks there, it was their first time to ever go out and experience the magic that is the [empty orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke).  Some folks who had been passive observers in the past got up and sang for the first time and some folks did old favorites that delighted the whole [izakaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izakaya).  I really do love the energy of this place and I would rank it above [Otter's Saloon](https://otterssaloon.com) as my favorite non-San Francisco karaoke spot if they carried soda water.  Still, with such a large turnout from the camp, the experience will rank as one of my favorites. 

https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/1020854278292877313


##### Speaker Brunch / Day 2

The second day of the event kicked off by the speakers and sponsors and volunteers gathering back at the White Horse for what I would accurately describe as a simple but pretty OK breakfast buffet and really stellar coffee.  I hesitate to call it a true brunch because the bar was not open during our special event and no mimosas, the defining beverage of brunch, could not be had.  It was still really good since it featured one of my favorite foods of all time, fried breakfast potatoes.  Waking up fully by catching up with some old colleagues and meeting some new folks was a real treat and put us all in a great mood for the second day of camp.  Huge props to [Cory Maass](https://twitter.com/corymaass) for kindly giving me a ride to the camp afterwards.

##### Dinner and coffee:

Since Day 2 is a little more than half the day, no lunch is provided. Just a snack break with pastries and more coffee and tea.  This meant that by the closing remarks many of us were famished.  Again, Mike Demo gets some praise from me for putting forth an option that could meet my diet, [Blaze Pizza](https://twitter.com/BlazePizza).  This 'Subway for fast fired pizza' type establishment not only wins in my book for having great ingredients, but also for having a terrific social media manager that engaged our tweeting and has a great sense of humor.  We finished our meal with a trip next door to get some coffee at [Blue State Coffee](https://bluestatecoffee.com/).  It was terrific to squeeze a few last moments with my WordPress family before heading off to the airport to return home to my beloved SF after what felt like a blur of a trip.

##### Keynote
[The Gutenberg Journey](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/keynote/)
[Tammie Lister](https://twitter.com/karmatosed)

Even with my going to as many sessions as I have about the WordPress 5.0 editor, AKA Gutenberg, and having just heard her give a [highly related talk](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/session/anatomy-of-a-block-gutenburg-design-patterns/) back at [WordCamp Europe](https://www.mcdwayne.com/2018/06/19/wceu-2018/).  This time Tammie gave a much more broad appeal talk about the why of Gutenberg with some great updates on the project's status and less about the individual features.  I walked away with a lot of optimism for what comes next as far as the end user experience.


Raw Notes:
easy to get started but
harder to learn fully
the WP Way is not always what we want
we deal with it and work around
is coping really the way?
It all started out with just words
was a flat way
now we want to publish rich content
Blur of White story
pre-Gutenberg
truly tells story 
should be very easy
Plugins 
we are too reliant on many 
held together with hope and Tetris
creating amazing work but hacking around blockades
this happens to all software
a rethink is needed from time to time
WP was unchallenged for the longest time
new planets being discovered in the publishing universe
not only the obvious choice anymore
SquareSpace, Wix, etc biting at the heels
not self hosted but orbiting and pulling in users
people don't want the hassle of caring for their own WP
Gutes is not a miracle cure
but it is a step to push us into the future
the foundations are the packaging
Thinking in parts and patterns
components - humans are great at this
principles are the same, all pattern recognition
Block by Block HTML editing prevents breaking whole post
safe container for content
once you understand how to use one block, know how to use all the blocks
Placeholders are very critical to the system
prompts to engage with the block
interactive
this allows for templating
less confusing experience than what is right now
true WYSIWYG path
direct manipulation
change it, you see it
we expect this now actually, we are super use to seeing this due to apps
touch devices trained us to think this way
we have need based options
if want to eat soup, don't need a utility tool with lots of options
bad experience leads to trust problems
just doing what is needed is primary to the experience Gutenberg is striving for
expected options
not kitchen sink, just what most users will expect
Safe exploration of new options, good for learning
the delight is what we want with Gutes
WP right now is people just coping
move on path to people thriving with the experience
accessible experience is good for everyone
key to this project
tips - welcome guide
the little nudges are helping educate 
editor needs to work across any device
mobile or apps are essential
performance is even more important on mobile
WP can be molded to the experience you want it to be
extending the CMS is very key
Gutenberg makes this more accessible
The Journey
3 phases
1. Editor - the one we are in right now
has taken longer due to the need to rebuild foundational level tings
2. Customization - more page builders - templating
3. Theme - not really determined
going to be a really exciting time as we get further along
most stats only show what has happened 
v1.0 8/29/17 
been 30+ releases
3, 128 closed issues
3,861 PRs closed
8/6/18 v3.2 - feature complete
bug fix and iteration now
Travelers
teams all across the web have joined this journey
Many folks have shaped the direction of the project
atomicblocks.com - new theme, set of blocks and plugins
even on its own its a great Gutes theme
testing and feedback been in the heart of the project
many different resources
booths and user testing
helping guide the 
10up.com/blog/user-testing-Gutenberg
the path ahead
lot more work left for sure
-4.9.8 Try Gutenberg callout 
-Feedback and iteration - all the wider feedback
stress cases expected
-Ready to get into core
alpha and beta releases
-5.0 - the thing all this phase is leading to
then start the next phase
a busy time for everyone in WP
The Future
personal views, not necessarily facts
the theme elephant needs to be dealt with
we will see more of a shift to style guides
maybe config files but not a lot more in themes
where editor and customizer start/stop will blend
themes create good boundaries 
Gutenberg will get us t where we should ave gotten by now
come join the journey

[Blobs, Chunks, and Blocks: Structured Content in the Age of Gutenberg](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/blobs-chunks-and-blocks-structured-content-in-the-age-of-gutenberg/)
[John Eckman](https://twitter.com/jeckman)

Whenever I get to tell my favorite stories, [John and The Southern V](https://twitter.com/McDwayne/status/937411987109220352) always is on that list.  A really down to earth and selfless guy who just happens to have a ton of experience running a super successful agency that donates a lot of open source code and furthers the projects in the process.  Still, even knowing him as I do, I have never seen him talk about a technical matter and in fact I have not seen him give a session since I started this project of publishing my notes about what I see.  This talk was a brilliant use of the case study model to explore multiple ways to solve an issue while discussing the wider implications of these lower level decisions.  As someone who does not think a terrible lot about taxonomies and re-usability of components in general, this was a wonderful exploration of how someone should be thinking about it.  


Raw Notes:
Interested in the concept of structured content
lot of great opp
We've been here before
Blobs
presentational logic and structure in one blob
makes reuse difficult, 
but faster to create
Chunks 
content broken into small structures components
separate presentation and structure
facilitate reuse
more planning needed to execute
in 2013, he argued WP is blobby but can be made chunky with ACF and such
enter the Gutes
blocks are making it easier to edit content
but is it making us more blobby or chunky
mixed
can get us to easier to develop and use
and preserve structured content
looking into code
it is better than blobs of html we had before
some structured
hypothetical case study
Metadata vs Data
Meta - Album- artist
-title
-Review - author
-date
-score
preGutes
WYSIWYG editor in content
Very blobby
no reuse
Not much consistency
very fast and simple
don't do this
if doing a one off post, not a bad idea though, bad for a site
round B - could shortcode to insert Album
structures the data slightly
use shortcode UI
still pretty blobby
hard to access data inside the shortcode
hard to track relationship of shortcode to posts using it
better way to do this, 
review CPT with specific post meta and taxonomy
template for CPT
more consistency 
but what about Multiple albums in a review
in print this is just there - review can account for multiple albums
Round 3 (pre-Gutes)
Review and Album CPT w/relationship
artist or label as CPT or Taxonomy
enables reuse: Show other albums by this artist
Editing is more complex, create album first then review it is mandatory here
Enter the Gutenberg
Round 1 
custom blocks for albums
editors can but it anywhere
but inconsistent
but no reuse
Better than the old blobby way?
round 2
Reviews CPT and Block template
consistent layout
some reuse of sections
round 2b reusable, shared, saved blocks for albums
Underneath the hood, saved blocks are just CPT with clock content
not easy to see if they exist already
still pretty blobby
Round 3
reviews and albums as CPT
Album CPT could still use a block template
set taxonomies on review based on Album CPT pull 
decent reuse
round 4
Reviews and albums as CPT
if Album does not exist, create it
set taxonomy and relationships on album save enable editing a a blovk 
Goal:
Get the editing experience of a blobby system where you edit the things you want
preserve the structured data to be able to reuse it
Why does it matter?
Future proofing
what happens when new devices get introduced and necessitates different combos of output
New features
consistency
single record for each object
Enable relationships
show other albums by this artist
show other albums by category
show other reviews of the a
Conclusions
block based editing can improve the experience
closer to WYSIWYG
more flexibility to move things around
Block based editing can make WP blobby
proper content modeling and planning are required

[The Basics of building a Gutenberg Block](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/the-basics-of-building-a-gutenberg-block/)
[Amanda Giles](https://twitter.com/AmandaGilesNH)

Given that the theme of so many of the sessions this year slanted toward the WordPress 5.0 editor, project Gutenberg, I decided to embrace it and sit through some sessions that I knew would be over my head technically.  This talk, while all topics I had sat through before, actually brought a few concepts together in my head rather nicely.  Amanda's code examples, all in ES5, which needs no build step, made a little more sense to me and I am starting to grasp these concepts, even without having learned JavaScript deeply.  I still have yet to actually do anything with this knowledge other than write about it and discuss conceptually with my peers but I do hope to get to explore coding something in the not too distant future for [the Gutes](https://twitter.com/thegutes).  


Raw Notes:
Gutes history
Anatomy of a block
comes with standard blocks
save and reuse blocks
it will soon appear
plugin now
WP 5.0
4.9.8 callout
classic editor plugin
transition
write your own blocks
almost entirely in JS
PHP is just to bring in files
abstraction layer over React
ES% or newer
ES5 2009
ES6 2015
ES8 is the current
they want a release a year
ESNext is the currently being worked on version
JSX is another component, JS XML-like syntax
needs a package manager
node, webpack, etc,
Many Gutes Block tutorial use JSX, but not all
this demo is in ES5
no build step needed
syntax differences
example code
Gutes handbook shows ES5 and ESNext
build a CTA in Gutenberg
block, background, button, etc
on the backend, in admin, 
5 steps to building a plugin
1 create plugin main file
2 register backend editor JS, CSS
3 register frontend CSS, JS if dynamic
4 in PHP:Register block type using register_blovk_typle()
5 n hooked JD file, call block in editor
steps 2,3 and 4 happen all together
tagged to the init hook
before we get into JS part
comes with JS libraries as globals
wp.blocks
wp.editor
wp.element
wp.components
wp.i18n
wp.date
others too
registerBlockType()
single JS call containing our complete block code
General info about the block including title, icon, category, keywords
code samples code samples

[Use Your WordPress Powers for Good](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/use-your-wordpress-powers-for-good/)
[Michelle Ames](https://twitter.com/michelleames)

Michelle is one of the nicest folks I know and her passion for teaching people how to WordPress is pretty inspiring.  She speaks a less technical jargon in her talks and makes the subject of 'how do I get started or advance in this stuff' extremely approachable.  Getting into the weeds of the code and technical matters is great, once you are ready to receive that, but this talk was really geared toward folks who are on their way there and are not sure how to get down that path on their own.  The short answer is there is no reason you need to do it on your own!  That is the raw power of our community.  There are hundreds, maybe thousands of people ready to answer any and all WordPress or industry related question so we all win together.  If you are down the path already, make sure you are remembering to help those who are not as far along the path of the WordPress way.  

Raw Notes:
We have all made bad websites
bad clients
made a little money
but we have fun
but we can do more
we can mentor people
introducing people to WP
giving them advice
that is how Michelle learned
this is what she taught her daughter's friend
later hired her
maybe can't mentor
teach classes
nothing to a bad website
why are you teaching other people, are they not competition
nope, internet too vast
she has never been in the same bid as anyone she knows
charge more and teach people
hold a clinic
basically happiness bar you are running yourself
teaching some basics, sometimes they decide they just need to hire someone
like her 
one a month Co-Working
just work on won stuff in the same room
gives you a set of resources and not working alone
exchange ideas
Teach someone like someone taught you
Speak up at a meetup
speak at a meetup
got hacked, fixed it, hacked again, learned why, fixed it right
tells this at meetups
organize a meetup
pay it forward
Pay it back to WP
participate in the forums
you likely know the answers to some of the questions
help with videos
can share around even if not as good as WP.tv quality
Help organize or volunteer at a WordCamp - the real heroes of WordCamps
wranglers
Help out at the Happiness Bar
You can just show up and help
she had impostor syndrome 
quickly gave way when first person asked about CSS 
Participate in a hack-a-thon
What else we get from giving back?
Friends!
we get clients from it!
new jobs!

[Subscription and Membership Based Income using WooCommerce](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/subscription-and-membership-based-income-using-woocommerce/)
[Ross Viviano](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/speaker/ross-viviano/)

Lately I have been getting more and more interested in the inner workings of Woo.  While I knew it *could* be possible to have a subscription and content behind sign up, I was very fuzzy on how that *actually* would work.  Ross lifted the veil on this and I have a much better handle on this topic now, which I am super thankful for.  A good WordCamp session is worth reading a hundred docs, and for me at least, I retain much more.  

Raw Notes:
Recurring vs one time payments
why?
more predictable revenue stream
some clients think easier to match their needs and expectations
one time payment system is scarier
what is needed
WooCommerce!
do need a payment gateway
Stripe or PayPal
paid Woo plugin called Subscriptions
Prospress
payment gateways are not all created easily, needs to have subscriptions built into it
25 officially supported one
Prospress has great docs to add to a plugin
as a personal note, important to have multiple gateways
install and setups
Simple Subscriptions
price
expire after
sign up
free trial - adds time to total expire after
sale price
default subscriptions
viable subscriptions
similar to variable products
add attributes to that subscription
recurring donations for a nonprofit
1 month-6 month-yearly
create variations from attributes
that makes 3 different subscription products
editing monthly subscription, drop downs
multiple variations possible
the possibilities are very extensive
customers can change per
if customer has more control inspires more confidence
status of the subscription and sub number and other meta
was as bulk editor view
lot of control over this screen
subscription details page
customer subscription status
everything can be customized
new email types
4 new coupon types that come with subscriptions
good for rewarding customers
Allow switching subscriptions
go from one plan to the other without re-sign up
simple subscription 
recurring, varying periods
full sign up fee when switching
like shipping use case
Memberships is another plugin
by SkyVerge
other plugins for this, but these are the 2 best
why is this needed, if using Subscriptions, you don't
but can restrict content on site based on groupings
Groups plugin is interesting too
length based memberships
posts category tags
pricing tiers tied to membership
import/export CSV - push to email marketing tools
memberships and subscriptions integrations
subscriptions enable recurring billing
team them up and you can grant access to content based on subscription level
able to use a free trial period
memberships supports that upgrade/downgrade model
only members of the level
example product: Meatball Pizza Bowl from Olive Garden
manage section shows details of subscription 
if accessing pages not in subscriptions, no access
remember everything is a post, order number and sub number can't be the same
every order is a post essentially
there are plugins to get sequential 
-Subscribe All The Things
can add subscription options to non-subscription type options
product bundles, mix and match bundles
subscribe to a cart before checkout
-Follow Ups
-WooCommerce Subscription Downloads
Teams for WooCommerce memberships

Just for reference here is the mentioned Meatball Pizza Bowl:

[(Slightly) Advanced Topics In Block Development](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/slightly-advanced-topics-in-block-development/)
[Josh Pollock](https://twitter.com/Josh412)

When Josh gives a talk, I do my dang best to keep up but I am so far beneath his technical prowess that I don't actually absorb all that much while in the session.  However, once I sit and think about it and reread my notes and think about it in context, I think these talks are a major driver of my development as a technical person.  Josh is also a truly great thought leader around how things can be implemented in a sustainable and scalable way.  He thinks in terms of 'beyond WordPress' and how to interact with the entire rest of the internet and that is exactly the kind of thinking that is going to make sure WP stays relevant long into the future.  


Raw Notes:
How do we 
yes this is complex to learn
but it solves so much
should  npm/yarn/etc?
pros
dependency management
consistency
automation
sanity is restores
cons
node_module get big
webpack
takes code and make it into browser safe
pros
full featured builder
helps get your files compiles and bundles
can transpile latest JS(babel) and anything else
also for CSS
cons
hard to learn
fast moving eco-system
ESNext
proc
cont, let, arrow, 
fetch
async
cons
--
--
every block is becoming own packages
npm i @wordpress/element
using react right now
all this stuff is put on wp Global
wp.element
don't have to build my own
if you enqueue these things can do on admin
or can npm install all these packages
you want core to lead things on the page, have to tell webpack not to bundle this on screen
in a WP plugin npm i -D @wordpress/name
in React App?  npm @wordpress/name
the webpack alias is used in Gutenberg core code
Using Jest and Enzyme
component testing
Snapshot testing
DOM testing
a11y testing
compares functionality snapshots to let you know when it breaks
JSX
yes
easiest way into react
Scaffolding tools for Blocks
npx...whatever
"I sort of understand webpack.  That's probably enough" - Josh Pollock
wp-cli scaffold 
wp scaffold plugin movies
wp scaffold block movie --tile="Movie Block"
on github:
Create Gutenberg Block
GutenBlock
react-wp-scripts
hot module replacement
Composing blocks
creating blocks out of modular components
modular building blocks - thinking in react
more usable and more testable, only one concern
using WP state management
Example 'Checkbox Controls'
Passing data back up
Inspector Controls
onChange

[Hiding the Pulleys and Strings](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/hiding-the-pulleys-and-strings/)
[Jesse Friedman](https://twitter.com/professor)

I went into this talk without reading the description based on the fact that I see all the PH CMSes I am involved with as 'glorified string manipulation' at its heart (credit to fellow Pantheor Ronan Dowling for the paraphrase).  Also based on the fact that Jesse's twitter handle is @professor, so I knew I would learn a lot.  I sat down and was met with something different than I had imagined but something very valuable.  I hear a lot about personalization but this talk maybe the best definition of the subject, complete with actionable examples, I have every heard of.  If you are interested in Personalization, make sure to check this one out when it hits WordPress.tv!

Raw Notes:
Personalization is not one thing
lady brought in a giant iMac into a Starbucks
a reorder button is not customization
predictive analytics and tracking and predicting actions is key
everyone thinks only the big companies are doing
who is visiting your site
what is their intent
Not everyone is there to purchase that product
don't tie me to the thing I bought, it might not be for me
Goals of a blog
subscribe and comment
share and stay
Albuquerque journal case study
increased engagement just by turning on related posts
Jetpack made this simple and automatic, reduced server load actually
Back to blog example
what pages visited
did they scroll all the way down ( mark posts as read)
did they do a search?
did they click any links (categories or tag)?
did they share?
did they comment?
let's take the subscribe button and change it to something personal
grab the category name and sub it in to what page they landed on for subscribe button
understand the path the user has taken
every tag has it's own RSS feed
you can subscribe to any tag feeds 
/tag/<actualtag>/feed/
add feed auto on comment forms, lets you reach back out easier
email follow up with commentators
akismet + manual looking at data lets you control this easier
thanks them, recap their visit 
give them back quick share links
customized search page
customized 404 search page
Goals
bring in customers
call or Directions
make a reservation
they are there for hours, directions, menus, specials, reservations
just want to get in and out of the site and server the data fast
goal should not be to have time on the site
Boston restaurant Pop Razzi
he just cared about up to date
but let's look at 2 users
1 is 500+ miles away while closed
2 is 10 minutes away from a location during business hours
we should think of them differently with different goals
level of intent
proximity coupons
Ecommerce sites
search is key
Google actually handles most search actually overall
nice prompt if repeated visits to a type of page
cart abandonment is an area we are focused on a lot in this market
coupon codes are popular now
no one uses this trick: in the email is a cookie
you can track open rates
if you tie a cookie to expiration date you can better understand intent
you can tie that to a campaign to fire off another email
2nd 2nd chances
(I had to go at this point due to setting up for my workshop)

##### My Session

[Let’s learn Git. No more excuses.](https://2018.boston.wordcamp.org/session/lets-learn-git-no-more-excuses/)

When I first heard that I was going to be able to teach a Git workshop at this event, I honestly thought maybe 12 or at most like 15 people would show up and roll up their sleeves.  About 50 people showed up.  As with every other time I have presented this subject there were people who needed a little more encouragement than others to actually embrace the command line and 'force-of-will' their way through this rapid fire curriculum.  I was kind of astonished that I saw very few people drop out, which I think mostly was to attend another session that started half way through this workshop spot.  

I want to take a second to say the thing that most blew my mind about this experience was the willingness of folks to help their neighbors through the rough spots.  I had not asked for, not prepared any assistants for this class (see opening paragraph of this section).  Without the dedication of a few specific people who just dropped everything and helped monitor the room and give personal attention to a students that were, in some cases, on the verge of giving up a few times, I don't think this would have gone nearly as well.  This is the very heart of our community.  Paying forward the help we all got along the way to stand as tall as we do.  In my overexcited mental state wrapping up the class and answering lingering questions from attendees, I did not record the names of my special 2 helpers and can not cite them by twitter handle or, shamefully, by any of their monikers, but your efforts will never be forgotten as long as I can recall this event.  Thank you to you if you are reading this. You know who you are.

##### Happiness Bar

There are few joys greater in my mind than helping a person understand the path forward on a problem.  This is the fun of working a [Happiness Bar](https://2016.jacksonville.wordcamp.org/what-is-the-happiness-bar/) shift.  From basic CSS modification to how to go about selecting the right theme to how to default your homepage to be a static page, I was pleased as punch to get to answer any and all questions.  I even got to have a great discussion with [Dave Ryan](https://twitter.com/0aveRyan) about the differences between shared hosting and isolated container architectures along with some other community members.  I know I have said it before, but if you do find yourself at or near a WordCamp in the future, sign up for a shift or just go hang out for a bit.  I think you would be surprised how much you can learn.

### Wrapping Up

I want to call out one person who didn't get a mention otherwise in this post and that is [Mr. Rich Hill](https://twitter.com/RichHill73).  I don't want to steal his thunder, but he is working on some content that I got to participate in that I think will very much help further many a community conversation.  I know it helped me gain some valuable perspective. He is one of the folks giving his all to try and solve a real need with his mind mapping based solution.  

Boston is really one of my favorite cities and so many good things happened on this trip, that even with the lengthy report I am still leaving off many details which I will treasure forever.  The community is beautiful in what is truly a [City on a Hill
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_nicknames) with so much rich history and forward looking innovation.  I can't wait to return and reunite with my New England compatriots, hopefully, at a minimum for [WordCamp Boston 2019](https://2019.boston.wordcamp.org)
