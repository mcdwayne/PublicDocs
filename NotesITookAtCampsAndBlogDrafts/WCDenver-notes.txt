WordCamp Denver 2018: In which I learned a lot while preparing to teach something and I talked very fast 

Somehow [City of the Plains
](http://got.net/~landauer/lists/CityOf.html) feels relatively local to me, even though it is 2 full hours in the air to get to and from this high altitude city.  Compared to placed like [Belgrade](https://www.mcdwayne.com/2018/06/19/wceu-2018/) or Boston(https://www.mcdwayne.com/2018/07/02/design4drupal-2018/) that is basically no real travel time.  There are also a lot of similarities between my part of California and that part of Colorado, with all the natural history and airport way outside the downtown area.  I was not there for the [great outdoors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Outdoors_(film)) or to sneak into the [Underground Music Festival](https://www.undergroundmusicshowcase.com/).  I got to return to this gem of the west to rejoice with my fellow WordPress community together in person at [WordCamp Denver 2018](https://2018.denver.wordcamp.org/)

[Whoâ€™s Afraid of the Big Bad Loop?](https://2018.denver.wordcamp.org/session/whos-afraid-of-the-big-bad-loop/)
[Chris Reynolds](https://twitter.com/jazzs3quence)

Issue is the loop make it sound like a magic black box
What is it?
codex definition.  HUh?
wat?
If have posts : whole have posts : the_post
if ( have_posts())
knock knock, do you have posts?
simple conditional that returns if there are posts, 0 or 1
keep going while it returns true
what are we doing
the_post - sets up the current post
think through all 'the' functions
the_ID, the_title, ect
the_posts makes all those work
setup_postdata( $post );
what does it al mean?
the magic
DB interactions
/?s=whosis chris reynolds
SQL querry
s post status publish
combine all these things
/?s=rynolds&post_type=wcb_speaker
query = new WP_Query([
's' => 'reynolds';
---
---
---
]);
And even more combining and complex searches and refinements
arrays can even be passed in
---MISSED SOME STUFF DUE TO EMAIL ACCOUNT HACKING ATTEMPT***********
using querys
used queryposts
national park service different pats of the help cernter differtn parts of site
s3q.uswcden2018-searchform
take taxonomy term and add to the search form so only search in taxonomy
in this case Museum management
get_posts
diff between this and wp_query
get_post returns: big array of post objects
dump out a quey, you get a whole bunch more stuff, array of post is way tat the bottom
it will tell you the sql qerry it used to find the posts
you can debug the querry itself
beneath that is array of post objects
doing the same things in general but 
query_posts (don't use it!)
set up the posts but does something
codex say don't use it
it overrides the main query
manipulates the posts you are in, that is bad
Slides:  s3q.uswcden2018-loop

[The Basics of Building a WooCommerce Website](https://2018.denver.wordcamp.org/session/the-basics-of-building-a-woocommerce-website/)
[Jamie Schmid](https://twitter.com/jamieschmid)

Intro to WooCommerce talk, her first one
plan, things she ran into people were not execting
also, general order of seting things up out of the box
Start with planning
Your product, types and attributes
your requirements, POS, sropship, billing, accounting 
payment processing
shipping and tax
sitemap
products, not all products the same, what is different
Reqs, do they have brick and mortar? Need POS? 
a surprise later is expensive
coming from etsy or Shopify or what?
can it be imported at all?  is it easy, almost never. 
Payment processing
check the requirements, do you need a backup (yes)
company paypal, stripe, authorize.net, si this determined?
PCI compliance? this is hard for some hosts
Shipping and Tax.  
ask the client to map the whole shipping process
figure out the rules with them
shipping rules, scenarios are import to walk through
Site Mapping, super important
terms and conditions
return policy, they absolutely need this
sizing chart
product pages
Now we get to Build it!  If we have all the above info, this is ready to start
The Woo Wizard is actually really helpful to get going from scratch
demo time!
Jetpack and TaxJar
wants to drill into payment gateways
don't process on your site if you can help it

[My Website Is Live, Now What Do I Do With It?](https://2018.denver.wordcamp.org/session/my-website-is-live-now-what-do-i-do-with-it/)
[Michele Butcher-Jones](https://twitter.com/Michele_Butcher)

when you inherit a site, they are clueless a lot
Expect them not to know and have to explain these peices
Hosting and FTP info
logging in for the first time
what plugins are there and why?
whats in the media folder
what is a post vs a page, people will ask!
What theme?
always use a child theme
'it's what makes it pretty' when explaining to clueless client
blog
update the site as soon as information changes
security for your sites
update! Update! UPDATE!!!
security plugins
regular checkups
always make backups
off server backups
without doing this, you can(will) get hacked
lose traffic and interest if not updated

[Keynote: Why Community is More Important than Networking]()
[Angela Bowman]()

her history, working wiht Nonprofits
learned some CSS
then learned about CSS
started on WP on v2.0
outside the box thinking
alone, didn't know anyone else doing this
meetup group of graphic designers
pivoted her life
partners and supporters
possibilities grow so much more
learned dos and don't together with Bethany Siegler
started teaching classes together to learn 
first wordcamp in 2010
WP is bigger on the inside
her first talk soon thereafter
camps are not just about free shirts
also about stickers and such
people put a lot of hope into WordPress
got to learn from each other
build relationships, it is why we are here
don't begin conversations with what do you do?
something different
asking what they do outside of their job
how can I help you vs what can you do to me
You never know how you are going to affect other people

##### My Sessions

[]()

I ended up talking really, really fast.  Jamming the same amount of information into half the time it took me to give the same talk last time certainly interjected a lot of energy into the thing.  It was fantastic to have a pretty big room reverberating that energy back to me.  I loved all the feedback I got afterward and it was super awesome to meet so many new people.  I hope I can give this talk a few more times before it evolves into another form. Thanks to all that came out!

Giving workshops is fun, but I would put it as a bigger challenge overall than a talk.  Both definitely take preparation and time and a lot of mental energy, but in a general lecture style WordCamp session you rarely stop and help someone try to figure out to debug a composer issue. I hope people got a lot out of it and I was thrilled to do it, but wow, I sitting and writing this later the same day I delivered it, I think I need to put many hours into a revamp before I submitted for a 3 hour workshop on this subject again.  I also thought that I might just require everyone to install [Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/) before we started so we would all have the same issues in the same environments. Still, very glad I got the opportunity to learn as much as I did while doing this and hope others found it useful as well.  





### Wrapping Up

Denver is an interesting town in a lot of ways.
