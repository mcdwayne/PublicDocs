### Sessions

[JavaScript APIs in WordPress](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/session/javascript-apis-in-wordpress/)
[Adam Silverstein](https://twitter.com/roundearth)

Really about functions and utilities and 
On github.com/adamsilverstein/wceu2018
Ma.tt told us to embrace JS deeply
Deeply = learning frameworks and build systems
Hello WP JS
RestAPI and Gutes, 
hello window.wp global where JS features live
the wp name space
in console
lot of objects to play with
objects tools 
docs are coming, workng on it
demo code
editor
ads.txt plugin
more code, see github
text to rich code editor
wp.media
you can customize the media editor
very complex, not good docs
tips
github.com/ericandrewlewis/wp-media-javascript-guide
plugin
attachment-taxonomies
from Felix
wp-heartbeat
periodic data transmission between client and server
runs at regular pace
data back and forth on schedule from multiple apps
very well documents
some hosts disable heartbeat due to server stress
import category of posts
2 main event, send and tick
5 seconds heartbeat is near enough real time for updates in a progress bar
wp.customize
customizer api
xwp/wp-customize-featured-content-demo
very well documented, start with the handbook
wp.ajax
workhorse in WP
wp.api
client helper library for REST API
post.set();
post.save();
wp.apiRequest
wp.utils.WordCounter
wp.sanatize
wp.a11y - speaks to screenreaders, important to JS heavy sites, annouce events to screenreads
WP NPM packages
npmjs.com/org/wordpress
gutenberg is making packages 
github.com/  
wp.hooks
lightweight and efficient EventManager for JS
Gutenberg hooks
pretty OK docs right now
github repo is good, but all falling out of date
wp.plugins
fill slots with custom components
wp.data
manage and interact with state
wp.element
similar to DOM construction and HTML
slew of tools in JS and APIs
NPM lets us build for WP and out of WP and in Gutes and out of Gutes
Q&A - When will it be merged?
A: April, don't know what year... :D
learn the chrome debugger

[When to use the API](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/session/when-to-use-the-api/)
[Sean Blakeley](https://twitter.com/SeanBlakeley)


Pragmatic
SCRUM based, 12 years or so in WP
API use in existing projects
today?
Why: what: when
tomorrow?
Why use it?
Devs and for the WP project
prior to the REST API WP was a monolithic block box
APi let us move data in and out of system, liberated data
so we can integrate with other services and systems
innovators delima
smaller software projects are going to disrupt and dominance means slow to change to react
WP needs to challenge it's own dominance, REST API and Gutenberg do this
what is it?
API is like a power socket in the wall
not useful into something is plugged in
translation of what we want to another audience
imagine sports company
want to use WP to make content
also want to ingest news feeds
select and publish some with summary and contextualizing
performance overhead is too much for WP directly
build a content API and do not change the WP layer
API delivery system
simpler architecture
start up wanting to show details of swimming pools
public queryable API
elastic search
WP as the GUI, the real work done by alternative storage system
Existing systems
Fairfax and HumanMade case study
presenting integrating experimenting
PIE
plugin Site In Numbers
Personalization
chunking into zones
push and pull into the JS layer
Using the Rest API to integrate into systems
sage ecosystem case study
advice service
Experimenting
Ionic app - run by WP site
WP as a game engine??
football matches
interconnectivity of objects
time and how it persists in the virtual world
Gutes: As we have moved into modular chunks, 
POst and Pages are black boxes
display or not
Gutes splits content into discreet blocks
Performance
transients as a way to store data
a-sync transients by 10UP
Tomorrow: 
start integrating with other services that was not possible before

[Miriam Schwab](https://twitter.com/miriamschwab)


Either going to love this or sleep through it
WP Garage
Strattic
most attacks XSS 
Cross Site Scripting
Load their code in your browser
once in that state, has access to your storage, dom, cookies
persistant Originate in the DB - comment injection
reflected: originates in the victim's request - bad link
DOM-Based - everything on the browser side
OWASP top 10
XSS the user is the victim, not the application
session hijacking/cookie theft, account takeover,redirects, unwanted ads, 
browsealooud
a11y extention in the UK and EU mostly
line of script to use
hack library and turned into crypto mining
CrytpoJacking

slower devices
100% CPU, etc
55% of orgs affected
weatherfor.us
How do we protect ourselves and users?
CSP constant security policies
just say what the good stuff is and what you want to load
very few people using it now
not included in the whitelist, does not load
CSP Syntax
Directives
Strings specifying type of resources
content-security-policy: default-src 'self' https:;
only allow https assets
script-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com
font-src
never
unsafe inline
unsafe eval
script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'
Nonce or Hashes more secure way to do it
upgrade-insecure-requests
subresource integrity - SRI
hashing to allow only when properly matching
don't use
x-xss, x-frame, 
how to add this in?
Server level headers, 
a functions
meta tag - can't be used with everything
also htaccess
header information and how content securit
keycdn has a tool
CSP evaluator from google
SOPHOS security haders
WP plugins Security Headers
https headers
SRI plugin
Report URI - tools for generating headers
telerik fiddler - only one that can read site and tell what need to add to security policy
adoption, 23,690 out of top Million sites
another way to test - script, plug into console

[Easing the anxious mind: dealing with anxiety in the workplace](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/session/easing-the-axious-mind-dealing-with-anxiety-in-the-workplace/)
[Laura Nelson](https://twitter.com/laura_nelson_)

Generalized anxiety disorder she manages
define anxiety
often banded around as worry or stress
anxiety is a constant 
1. Keep a diary
a worry journal
in real time
rank them and 'n/10' score
exhausting stuff
2. Make plans and stick to routine
hard as a freelancer 
give yourself time to think about things
3. talk about it
it can be hard at first
You are not alone
60 Million people in the EU suffer from anxiety
4. Be kind to yourself?
give yourself a break
what's a resonable adjustment
1. Work starts when they get there, start later
2. Keep a nice working environment
3. promote a healthy work-life balance
4. listen

[WordPress and Inclusive Design](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/session/wordpress-and-inclusive-design/)
[John Maeda](https://twitter.com/johnmaeda)

inclusivity is hard since it requires change
pushing our limits
fashion always pushes limits
design pushes you to think differently
forces interaction by questioning how it is supposed to be
wapuu silloette  - some anger but creator loves it since people are using it
without change we only have death
wants to start an Automattic design award focused on experience
issue with design in tech - shallow design
engineer and dev, does not work, refix it until it does work
too tired to make it usable
too tired to make it feel good
spray design on it
trying hard to make it look not bad
deep design is not like rocket science, it is 4 things
discovering the problem
hypthesize how to fix
deliver the solution
listen and look at how people use it
we love shipping it, we do not like the feedback
we are very focused on delivery
in deep design must spend time on listening and discovering the problem
hypothesize
all about creative, not about the money
but after a while, should he worry about the money
got his MBA
found that it is important to understand the money
Apple control ov aluminum and proces
not many alluminum 
ability to bend wood
teaforte tea bag vs green tea in traditional bag
analagy for our modern day
FOSS vs Free but I will spy on you
best way to enhance that core service is the experience
eveyone copies what is better, like the iPhone x clones
we are in less than 5% of the world thst unfrtppt

[Intro to Drupal (for WP folks)](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/session/intro-to-drupal-for-wp-folks/)
[David Needham](https://twitter.com/davidneedham)


HIs origin story
in a class, a professor made them write a CMS
then said "That is why you don't write your own, now use an OSS one"
everyone else chose WP, he was encouraged to use Drupal
he got involved in the community
volunteering is very important
What is Drupal?
Dries in Belgium created one fo the first social networks
a website where friends could share things like photos
he open sources it and that is what Drupal came from
6% of the top 10K websites
that is where it excels, at the top
over 1Million devs and growing
Drupal.org
Free as in beer
free as in speech
free as in puppies
A website also requires feeding and care
D8 is object oriented
Symfony PHP framework
known as being hard to learn, but standardized now
but a professional PHP from a different project can learn it faster
small business owner at a camp hiring Drupal experience
but since D8 move, as long as they know OOP PHP they can work there
A new person with no Drupal background made a core commit on first atttempt since he knew PHP OOP
Drupal is modular
the ecosystem is different, no commercial modules
no ongoing support contract around the modules
Also means less fragmentations
OSS from the Drupal community means all the code back to D.O
Drupal is themable, 
extremely customizable
down to a per piece of content basis
box of legos, makes it harder to approach
built in data structure, specific content and field calls
meta around that
very good for data analysis or connecting to multiple applications
Structured content
core, very key to how it all works
build your own data structures
and access/roles is built in
staff directory example
Chicago Park District example
facilities - name, type, photos, address, photos, hours
data created elsewhere and pulled in
editors also editing
pushed out to a few other places
Views 
kinda ugly interface to be honest
but configurable in any ways to display anything
slideshow, sidebar footer, whatever
block display
custom admin tables
Hong King Trade Development Council
using Views to build a dynamic front page on their site
Drupalcal to meet the community
free Drupal training online too
experiencing like a different country
see the world a little bit different
advocating checking out other communities and out of your comfort zone
in conclusion, the website for his class
it ended up doing very well and 
had a fully functional ecommerce store for fake things
not here to convert you
motivation is to show that we are similar
more alike than different
grown together
Drupal had content types: WP Post Types
Drupal query building: WP has this too actually from Plugins
Gutenberg is also being thought of in Drupal form a different philosophical point
but get out there and learn

[Origins of Design Inspiration](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/session/origins-of-design-inspiration/)
[Simon Cooke](https://twitter.com/SiCooke23)


bob dykan quote
Finding something,
like inspiration was a think
Egyptions thought it was a spirit
Greek throught ti was something that followed you around, genius
map of the mind in modern times
looked at Design theories
many ways to bubble up ideas to the top
at Pragmatic they use "desing thinking"
David Kelly thought leader around this
5 sections
Empathy
Define
Ideate   <----where we will spend most time in this talk
Prototype
Test
things start with rough sketches
digitize and 
mussli (SP?) mewsly?
mindmapping input in new chrome windows
ideation is brainstorming
input and output
I don't believe the value of brainstorming is the ideas gneratied
value lies in the shared perspective of the people who participated (paraphrase)
Tim Sheiner of Salesforce
Lot of tools availble, may be equal, but some can be more inspirational
The Process:
Start with our own habits
Daily Adventures
change it up, do something different, introduce simple change to change frame of mind
drink something different, new coffee shop, take a different path
Rythme, normally about timing
creatives are creative peaks 7-11am AND 4-9pm 
ideation meeting, don't do it at 2:00pm
Daniel H Pink book "When" on mood swings supports this theory
that curve is split in 2
morinng spike is hyper focused state of mind
most ah-ha moments though are in the evening peak 4-9pm
creative minds need time to chill out, less pressure 
brains get to wander and connect the dots of all experiences recently
that is where creativity really happens
Influence is the past major point of ideation for him
Influence = inspiration
they are equal
transformed in equal quantity
digital environment
physical world
community
digital - screenshots of phone, lot of visual and written content
very much influencing him
other digital content, blog posts, httpster.com, 
WOGD - high quality content
http://womenofgraphicdesign.org/
jotting a lot of notes at night
in morning then process it
podcasts and audiobooks
Physical world up next
fun, slides and stuff
should feel comfortable in your working space
but can not comete with volume of written data on digital
but different
experience as much as you can of the physical world
community, there are the people around you
friends, family, co-wokers, Campers
recap:
Tools - find the ones that work for you
Process - tweak a few habits and find a rhythm
Influence -  influence = inspiration
challenge, help someone find inspiration in you and find inspiration in them

[Anatomy of a block: Gutenberg design patterns](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/session/anatomy-of-a-block-gutenburg-design-patterns/)
[Tammie Lister]()


Not a technical talk
about the ideas behind design of Gutenberg
basically everything is a block
all we should hav to learn is how the blocks work, then we will know all of it
roots of it, sketch of it
basically based on the whole experience of WP
blueprints (shws a design sketch of the thing)
element bar
sidebar blueprint
status, revisions, all the things you expect with WP
adding block
shared and reused blocks
walkes through nexted block and other blocks
blueprint of a standard block
bar, menu, and arrows
sidebar can be moved and placed as you prefer
Doc sidebar is same as in block sidebar, always there
primary and secondary action
toolbar has primary actions
things it should not function without it
secondary are anything else
tranformations
any block can become any other kind of block
work moving tranform into one place
Unselected placeholders
selected and with content
unselected but contains content
hoverstate
basic anatomy of a block
example
Gallery block
much closer to true WYSIWYG
every bock should give a preview
and show you what to do intuitively
Blocks should adapt
blocks usable on all devices
Where should blocks live?  Plugins so they can be reused!
leave the themes alone
Direct manipulation
receive immediate feedback
expected user experience
Block Styles
editor block
when should you build a block?
there are also other ways to do it
potential ideas are boundless
making content with not much or
Tips - new user experience guide
a bti of a story
thanks for all the contributions

[Beyond Gutenberg](https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/session/beyond-gutenberg/)
[Matías Ventura](https://twitter.com/matias_ventura)

how the things have been made and how it is going is goal of talk
30 releases in one year
200+ contributors
3000+ code merges
how to bring a blocked based experience without fragmenting the community and content
took a while to arrive at blocks
pricipals
oblitimize for the user
content first
no lock-in
incremental developer
Semantic web
since WP inception this is central
block editing is concern of maniplating content but not for display it
HTML as the format
page as the privelidged entity and more meaningful experience
lift up and manipulate blocks
slightly higher order HTML
we are using native HTML tool manipulate content
block attributes
demo time
mainthing since last time he talked is calumns block
markdown FTW
reusable blocks
scales up
seeing a lot of plugins creating blocks
needs testing help with
nested blocks
templates
layouts and 
child blocks
API tools to allow mixtures of blocks and templates
reusable layout units
locking templates is new as well
experience new page mock up from Mel Choyce
