Team Publishing in WordPress
Steve Burge
Google Docs is advanced, even Ma.tt said so.  
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KIqdKB49aR_c6G8Tqv770rjFCvru63KBz4lvWkCVKAg/edit#
plugins to import
see multiple companies do that
PublishPress solves some of this, like calendaring, but quite honestly Google Docs is better as some things still
What about:
Multiple by-lines
bylines.io
: or permissions
Fine grained permissions with Google Docs, want that for WP? 
share publicly with world. Maybe, somewhat
permissions add ons are not great
This brings up Guettenberg and ultimately Calypso and the future there

The Biggest WordPress Myths Debunked
Lauren Jeffcoat
Myth 1) It is just for blogs
It is not just for blogs, it got popular since it was easy to publish, but yu don't have to just publish blogs
2) Plugins are bad or cause trouble. 
False: bad plugins are bad and too many bad plugins are bad, but only use what you need.  
If you don't use it, just lose it!  Delete those inactive plugins, or keep them up to date
3) WP is too complex
wrong, this is not true, lot of easy ways to get started nd many tools and training resources to help
best practice to have a standard way to do things solves a lot of these issues.  
4) it is not secure
WP is a big target, but it is up to good practices, hosting and code.
a good hosting company can help boost your site's security
6) You get what you pay for...free = no quality.  no support!
wrong!

Taming the Whirlwind
Nathan Ingram
No one has all of it under control
You are not alone
the common struggle
We Undestand the Need for strategy, but Doing it gets messy
Putting a name to your problems help to understanding and defeating problems
he calls it the Whirlwind!
The energy and attention needed to run your business
the Whirlwind is the URGENT!
Then urgency and importance clash, urgency wins every time
The whirlwind never goes away!
delaying strategy doesn't work
The whirlwind isn't bad, it just is!
you need a plan to accomplish your goals in the middle of the whirlwind
Without a plan, the whirlwind always wins
The PLAN!
initial planning 
weekly planning
weekly execution

initial planning - 2 hours unplugged
schedule it as a priority
2 hours - 2 tasks
1) Identify the issues
	that changes do I need to make?
	Which brings most immediate requests
	ID your top 3
Your best friend in this is momentum

2) plan action items
break each into goals that take 2-4 hours each, if take longer break it down into parts

You Donâ€™t Need a Plugin for That
John Tucker
Saw the need for a google map
not a lot of good options, all complained each other
ACF for page layout
If could use custom fields for that, why not tie into Google Maps
WP Custom Post Types -> ACF -> WP Page Template -> Google Maps JS API
Used a child theme

Connecting in a Digital World
Jodie Riccelli
Not a designer or dev
an agency 
WebDev Studios, client strategist
work with clients from conception of idea oer to design and developers
interprets what the client wants into docs
some of them very long
Sales became a bit f a dirty word and she wants to clean it up
We don't know how to engage, we want to be at a distance.  Apps do this
"My Students don't know how to have a conversation" - from the atlantic ,Paul Barnwell
Sales = providing solitons the challenges the client might be having while being conscious of their budget
Everyone has something to teach you
Let's use words that entice engagement
Use CRM to set up template emails
Keep Informed!!!

You Created A Plugin. Now What?
Adam Warner
It all starts with wp.org
largest collected pool of users
upgrades and extensions are the way to monitize
increasing sales is next goal
repo meta matters
5 star reviews are great but replying to the 1 star reviews is super important
Copy  that drives installs, good content and good docs
algorithm phase 1, 
SEO summary since the redesign
Content marketing is important!
Kimba.com built in templates
exit discounts
Cross promotions
What will you chgre, what will the market bare?

	A/B Testing, Which Way Does Your Duck Face?
Mike Demo Demopoulos
A/B Testing is:
	Controlled - you can explain how things relate to one another
	Statistically Relevant - educated guessing
	Micro Testing - changing one thing at a time
Don't try to assign reason to user actions, you can't. it will drive you batty.  Let the data drive all decisions.
	That to test?  
		buttons
			drop shadows, color, size, font, etc
		text
		images
		everything
	play and have fun!  - get to mess wiht other per's
