###Sessions

[It’s ALIVE! How I built the Wapuu Bot using Javascript, Slack and the WP API](https://2018.miami.wordcamp.org/session/how-i-built-the-wapuu-bot-using-javascript-slack-and-the-wp-api/)
[Rick Tuttle]()

Japan 2009
created
then coffee wapuu, michelle schulp
cafecitowapu twitter account
slackbot
slack app, send a recieve mesaages between endpoint
spanglish 'no es facil'
WCMia site feeds this slack
can search @wapuu find ____
returns values
pulled WC schedule from the website
mongoDB for a caching layer
more fun to assign him a personality instead of just a pile of code
Wapuu is a 'Bot user' in this case
also a bot user app that can reply directly or mention in ambient content
Natural language processing is hard, lot of exceptions
schedule data from WP (npm request-promise)
fetch from wp-json/wp/v2/sessions
cache schedule data (formatted JSON) in MongoDB for quicker/easier retrieval
App used monk from Automattic
WP is really becoming a content repository
finds mentions and posts
likes serving up coffee
load of api and other resources/services used in slides
one of the hardest things is getting started.

[15 in 15 – The Story of WordPress](https://2018.miami.wordcamp.org/session/15-in-15-the-story-of-wordpress/)
[John James Jacoby]()
JJJ

B2
Sourceforge code there but maintainers gone in 2003
Original wp.org was just ugggggly
slowly got better over time
dashboard was primitive
no theme support
adoption of 1.5 started growing
Dashboard area in WP 2, blue was introduced
post rows manage
meta boxes
no visual editors, precursor to post preview
custom field metadata exposed first time
if we cound re-write WP it would be like BBPress - ma.tt
2.5 first real Admin redesign
this is when some people first took WP seriously
2.7 revisions nitrdcused
still Kubrick in there
WP 3.0 Post editor, inwrtos to 2010 theme
3.2 'my account' is JJJ's fvorite things' in WP

On Building Community From Twitter to #IRL
Raquel Landefeld

We hide behind social media
WHat are motives
what is the purpose? 
connecting with people is what it is all about
not collecting business cards
intentional connecting and human relations building
make friends by being friends
shift focus to create relationships not just grow business
