WordCamp Montreal: A better version of Paris without having to cross the ocean.  

Montreal is a beautiful, awesome and much better version of what they are shooting for with Paris.  To be clear, I am not comparing [WordCamp Europe](https://www.mcdwayne.com/2017/06/20/wceu-paris/) here, just the actual cities.  I got to come directly from [Minneapolis](https://www.mcdwayne.com/2017/08/08/wordcamp-minneapolis-2017/) to

###Food and Fun

Speaker Dinner
[Lunchoenette](http://www.lunchmtl.com/) has a very nice slogan, "Feeding the community one meal at a time". Very good food and extra friendly staff.  I have mentioned it before bu

#####Karaoke
#WCKaraoke happened on Friday night instead of Saturday night at this camp.  We went to [L'Astral 2000](https://m.facebook.com/Astral-2000-494597793884464/)  This had a few direct effect.

###Sessions


#####My Session
[Letâ€™s learn Git. No more excuses. (in English) ](https://2017.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/lets-learn-git-no-more-excuses/)


I taught a Git workshop the Thursday night before camp.  This was hard for me mostly because I had never done this before. I have taught workshops before, but about improv, which has no reliance on  Getting a room full of strangers at all varying levels of skill and experience on the same page about the core concepts and 16 basic commands upon which everything else in the version control system is arguably built was a challenge.  One I am very, very glad I undertook.  I called the session "Let's Learn Git.  No More Excuses!" and not "You Learn Git" or even "Learn Git" because the reality is I am still learning it.  I am firm in my belief after talking to a lot of developers over the years that *everyone* is still learning Git and we are all somewhere on that journey together.  
Thank you to all who came out.  I hope you walked away with a new perspective on some concepts.  I know I sure as heck did.  
If you want to see what I taught, feel free to look at [my slides, located here](https://goo.gl/oS4ZbG).  I made everything animated Gifs to avoid live demos as much as I could, which I think might be a mistake for a workshop in retrospect.  But it does mean each student has a reference material to what the successful execution of the command actually looks like and for that reason alone I am super glad I made the gifs.

#####Opening Remarks

[From zero to launch: A walk-through of the website process](https://2017.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/from-zero-to-launch-a-walk-through-of-the-website-process/)
[Lisa Ghisolf](https://twitter.com/gizmodesign)

When working with clients Important to nail down stakeholders and scope
Redesign considerations
- benchmark where the site is now.  (CrazzuEgg, OptimalWOrkshop, also analytics you can do it) 
- Heat maps are a good idea
- what links are live and broken (Google Search Console)
- what links have changed
Discovery you need a lot of things for
Clients, stakeholder, purpose, competitoin, Audiences, Client Requirements, Scope, Analysis, Collect Data. Collect Brand Materials, Content Audit
Knowing what you want is the most important thing.  
content structure, functionalities.  
New sitemaps (she is a huge fan of the sitemap)
wireframes, Custom theme or template? prototypes, design acceptance.
Maintenance is becoming more important
Wire framing, she likes [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), slick plan also works. 
"No one is really looking up your name except you and your mom"

[F******k Instant Articles: How do they work?](https://2017.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/fk-instant-articles-how-do-they-work/)
[Jer Clarke](https://twitter.com/jerclarke)
Facebook
Going where the users are, even though they are bad and giant companies are ruining the world
Global Voices international news websites
Assumptions
You ru  your own WP site
FB is a source of traffic
Mobile traffic
You don't want to use wird awful ad networks
your soul is for sale
iA post load 'instantly' 
stored copy in a FM format rathe than load yor site
does not share or post to your FB page
but it means when shared visitors see instant artcile version
URL gets sorted for Desktop or mobile
Effectively it replaced your theme to the end user
you do not have ay real options, just take it as it is or don;t use it
FB preloading the article
Want to use AMP?  
OK you can do that
Accelerated Mobile Pages
custom 'theme' uses your content to match the AMP standard
google caches there and serves them, fast for mobile visitors
google gives this content special treatment (carosel)

"You are going to have a terrible time with page builders" 

Why not?
Hands control of your content to FB
Violates open web principals
content must be crammed into limited format
no load on server traffic
ads integration available
FB probably giving iA an unfair advantage[citation needed]

WHy iA anyway?
Super Fast
better on mobile
only uses URL as the web address of posts (unlike Amp)
analytics integration available
no load on your server
ads available
FB probably giving iA an unfair advantage[citation needed]

If you trust FBm they have marketing that says 20% more clicks, 70% less abandon (makes since beacuse you just start reading), 30% more shares.  
at Global Voices 250K iA hits in one day
each one blazing fast, no load at all on server

Getting it set up?  
A lot of things are sutomated and a lot are hidden, they assume you are a full CMS and writing the interface on your own, they don't talk plugin like you want
1) Get a FB page
2) Instant Articles for WP is the plugin you want
adds admin menu, sidebar

[Exploring the case for serverless WordPress](https://2017.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/exploring-the-case-for-serverless-wordpress/)
[Max Kovalenkov](https://twitter.com/m0ntrealist)
Service called Shifter, he foudn it and wants to talk on it
JAMstack, a website building JavaScript, APIs and Markdown
no server or DB when viewing page
store everything in git, CDN to deliver static page generator
JS is glue to pull content

Why?
Faster than server, no PHO
doubles as a hosting solution
Fast load times and scale
ver-r-ry secure

Drawbacks: 
no search, comments, contact forms WP-API no work, lose it all
yet another dashboard
only "pretty" permalinks are supported

Impressions:
at first, very excited!  so much, he signed up for this talk!
but drawbacks are real, support was spotty, feels not mature,
But be sure to keep an eye on this space

When authoring, docker container is spun up, temp admin access

[Plugins and You: Finding that perfect plugin](https://2017.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/plugins-and-you-finding-that-perfect-plugin/)
[Miriam Goldman](https://twitter.com/mirigoldman)
Warning, high level for beginners.
How do you find a plugin?
What is a plugin?  Functionality, not design, independent from themes
Add new official wordpress repo, but google is good for investigating
admin
Free vs Paid:
Free is good for basic functionality
Freemium, has free but additional features cost
Paid: fully paid, ontem most robust, good support from Developer
Personal recommendations

[Plugin Development Demystified](https://2017.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/plugin-development-demystified/)
[Yannick Lefebvre](https://twitter.com/ylefebvre)
He wrote books on this, rare to talk outside of Montreal
Search deep when looking for available plugins, sometimes you are re0inventing the wheel
Plugings are best for packaging up code for a site, lot of advantages, reusable, independent form theme, supportable

Basic PLugin File Structure
Comes as a zip file
code editor is better than notepad
Must have a local website
image editor optional
coupled block of code with a header

Action Hook:
Do you want to do something when an event occcours?
Event - WP is displaying a page header
Respinse; Execute plugin code
Add Action
Most hooks can be found in the codex
864 action hooks

Filter Hook:
1674 filter hooks available
action spit out data immediatly
filter receives data and modifies

Shortcode:
[] codes
simple codes in a post or page to insert content
or can be used to output special content
Examples:
You can develop your own admin menus
admin pages of your own
Extend the user editor
custom post types
add custom meta boxes to any editor
new widgets

Store and retreive plugin settings

Considerations!
Function names are different than any WP Core Functions and other plugins
BEst practice is give unique to you prefix.  
Local first is best!
Entire conent is evaluated each time, can take down site as a whole

Publishing your plugin
Free plugins only
Must follow GPL
Discoverable from admin plugins page
built in update mechanism
Marketplaces (code anyon, MOJO Marketplace, WPEden, etc)
Paid premium, be warned support burden must higher

custom plugins can be made with just a few lines of code
delivering custom code by plugins 
consider distributing your plugins

[Preparing a Plugin for Translation](https://2017.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/preparing-a-plugin-for-translation/)
[Brian Hogg](https://twitter.com/brianhogg)
This is important since we need language to work
__ (double underscore is key)
_e = __ + echo
sprintf
What is you want to output HTML?
smae _e works with link inside of it.

locotraslate is a plugin approach

[Rapid Mobile Prototyping in React Native with WordPress](https://2017.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/rapid-mobile-prototyping-in-react-native-with-wordpress/)
[Ptah Dunbar](https://twitter.com/ptahdunbar)
Organizer WC Miami
Moved to asia, no desktop
day to day job dev
React native is easiest way to build mobile/access with WP
This is an avanced talk, not too  any slides
Atwood's law
"any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript."
Learn Javascript deeply
BIg different
We're going mobile
This time with a native touch
using WP as a backend
Cool example from WCMiami feedback app
Topics:
usign JASON REST API
React native
Atchitecture Review
Install/setup 
...
..
.

React native viable?  Yes, FB, Insta, AirBnB, many more apps already using it
co-exists with native code itself
fetch is the new thing just extending with custom end points to connect content with device
Example:
fetch token retuens username/password
Must use HTTPS
Can't connect ht http in app store

React Learn one, write everywhere
target ALL the mobled
native device performence
Actively growing community
each compenent does one thing really well 

INstalling it is few commands
yarn global add react-native-cli
react init MyTalkRocks
cd MyTalkRocks
yarn
FB docs on react native is thorough! bookmark it

once installed and set up, new directory

Builds the visuals of the interface, these are the new parts that make native native, can now access these things
always a render method, view is like a div, CSS flexbox used under the cover
wrapping view
Aview
Image
simple react properties, style and sizing
Navigation can be tricky, but great app package called React Navigation, 
leverage what the community built, lot of things created already for you
can get far pretty fast
Easily drive a view of:
-splash
-auth
-main
Demos all the way!

[Our Hybrid Future: WordPress As Part Of The Stack](https://2017.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/our-hybrid-future-wordpress-as-part-of-the-stack/)
[Josh Pollock](https://twitter.com/Josh412)

REST API, new era of WP, 
Blog -> CMS -> Platform -> ?
Slots into a larger architecture
WP all the things??
is WP a magical unicorn?
monolithic vs microservices architecture 
Examples of microservices
transactional Email Services
Tak Runners for CRON
Separate DB
Media Libraries on s3
CDNs
Decoupled front-ends via REST API
Containerized hosting architecture

Microservices encapsulate functionality!

Caldrea Forms Pro as a case study
Hybrid web app really

Free plugin - client plugin - services
plugin works on own, works better with their app
users control their own data

Service based solution, techs not normally used in a WP site
Laravel, Lumen, VueJS, Vuetify, MariaDB, Redis, AmazonS3, Ec2, Linode, SendGrid and many more
lets them do one thing at a time without having to touch all the other parts
makes improvemetns faster and easier

Composer and package management are vital to this stuff, to save having to copy/pasting code and repeating themselves
not WP specific

can always Communicate via APIs

Easy Digital Downloads already handles recurring billing and user account stuff, they use

[All About Images](https://2017.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/all-about-images/)
[Mike Dickson](https://twitter.com/themiked)

When you upload an image there is a lot of shit going on
embed is not short tag it is full embed, will mess up as you move it.
Opinionated defaults
link to none, then you insert (other options, attachment page and media file)
wordpres will not up-res
raster vs vector
color on grid vs math
sharpening is an optical trick to change shading between pixels
SVG are a massive security whole
img-optin
jpegmini
SRGB every time - browsers ignoring your headers to show them
