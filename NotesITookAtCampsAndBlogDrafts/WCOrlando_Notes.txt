#####Day 1
I didn't try the conference coffee.  Nothing against it, but was feeling a team mood and that is a consistent experience thanks to the fine folks at [Twinings Tea](https://www.twiningsusa.com/).  

Lunch was interesting since I saw no veggie options, I assumed there were none.  I missed the tweet that said to ask the servers and they wold make you a fresh plate fo alternative foods.  This was not a huge concern because fellow vegan food enthusiast [Josh Pollock](https://twitter.com/Josh412) of [Caldera Labs](https://twitter.com/CalderaWP)

Firefighter
lot of free time between shifts
did't want to be a handyman or grass cutter
went on interenet,
kept getting pointed to Web Developer
liked no set schedule and could be remote
internet is not going anywhere
growing industry
Found out about how websites work
youtube totorials
html
borrowed MacBook Air and bought a chromebook and installed linux

hacky but a little sandbox
You can only ask Google so much
I needed like minded people

introvert
thought people would be too advanced
but happy to fine people of all skill levels
excited to be around people also passionate about things
Q&A asked how is everyone learning
Lynda.com free with library card in Orange county
helpful nature of others, hard to do with Linux
commandeer the macbook air
Reputable online learning is key
Free: Freecodecamp and W3school
Paid: Lynda.com, Treehouse, Udemy
Skeptical of learning online
hands on
Ability to pause and take notes
Ability to replay courses
in browser code editing alongside the videa (most hands on)

[Tech and the Time Warp: How the ever changing tech world shatters stereotypes about age, ability and experience]()
[Miles Lifton](https://twitter.com/KidCoderDev)

It is inspiring to hear young people 

Born in 2006, always loved tech
Tech is moveing faster than a bullet train
thing from 10 years ago no longer work today
for example python 2.5 and 3.0 are different compilers
WP is older than Twitter and 27% of internet 
WP started with a dozen users in 2003, released for free
little drop turned into a sea
history of the mobile phone
supercomputers in our pockets
python timeline
moving so fast means never a bad time to start
anyone can jump in
can do things other than be a dev
Social media 
What draws you to tech?
What drives you forward?
What is your passion?
everything we think is going to happen in the future is already here
tomorrow starts today
like a ball of clay
love to learn
the community gives
global reach
He was going to learn Apple, iOS 6 buggy
was referred to a local college professor
had a TA help him out
Wants to go to DefCon and BlackHat but you have to be 18+
CES is even 18 and over
People make all sorts of assumptions about 
If you are speaking to someone in their 2nd language you are speaking to thier mind
if you speak in their first language you speak to their heart
languageisnotabarrier.com
WordPress is moving faster and faster
We need fresh minds to learn new things
once you learn one thing, you are spurred to learn more
Asks the audience about their ideas 
commentary on how to help leverage their community to reach your goals

[The Ups and Downs of Transferring Your WordPress Site](https://2017.orlando.wordcamp.org/session/the-ups-and-downs-of-transferring-your-wordpress-site/)
[John Hughes](https://twitter.com/johnhughesgolf)

Not a coder
not a designer
A do it yourselfer
A golf pro
always trying to learn 
Masters Professional training level, the PHD of his industry
Family comes first, 
does a lot of talks
first site one page really simple
grew it from there and rebuilt
ended up on page 7 of google
was doing all own SEO, learning as he went
lot of CTA issues on early sites
redirects broken, poor email and bounces
poor loading times
poor photo compression
92% bounce rate
no theme uppdates, developer unresponsive
feels this is a standard postion people can find themselves in
his host: poor customer service
unexplained downtime
shared server vulnerabilities
Unreliable website
last year, july 2016 made a game plan
needed better uptime, security, more options
change theme - you get what you pay for
Elegant themes, Divi - Siteground is what he went with
135 domain names
best practices how switching over works
Got to do your homework
research and ask questions - not all hosts are for all people
ask for free trials, never hurts to ask
Once a decision is made but before moving your site to a new host
fix any simple tasks of content, links, image compression
don't move junk
kill unused plugins, the slow your site down
review site on all devices and browsers possible
53% of users are on mobile devices
backup site and DB and export 
While leaving site live on existing host, transfer site files to new host company
pay for the extra services to do as much of this for you as you can
create a staging area, new environment
test/review on all deviced from stage
backup site 
after transfer
explore options
change theme
clean up errors
test, test test, 
try to break it and take notes
Results
SSl 
Amenities offered improved backups and such
customer service is outstanding
more secured environment
While site is still live on original host
create backup
make a list of changes you need in new theme
Test everything
again use multiple devices 
important that it works right before you turn it live
do things consistently
make sure all links work
Agencies are good at this
it is a time vs money equation
if you have more money than time, good idea to talk to an Agency
otherwise use checklists and time
Backup often
he did it every 2 weeks but you can do it however often makes tou feel good about it
cta buttons are a big thing for his industry
increased his revenue 
results
99% uptime
excellent customer service
technicaly complex tasks done by host company
decreased load time
bounce rate of home page
less clutter, more functions
Siteground walked him through it first time
taught him how to do it

[Watch Edit Repeat: Today’s Story of User Tracking](https://2017.orlando.wordcamp.org/session/watch-edit-repeat-todays-story-of-user-tracking/)
[James Tryon](https://twitter.com/JamesTryon)

That is the point of user tracking?
1 - making sure your site/app actually works
2 - make sure your marketing budgets are being spent in the correct areas
Do you really know how your users are using your site?
understanding where they came from
understanding where you should focus your marketing $ on thing that work
how to
ga-devs-tools appspot campaign builder
not direct GA
spend money on fancy tools
new spreedsheet is how they track it, simple and portable
using Buffer to manage social media
reshared and have some decent followers have good way to track them
utm term and campaigns
onClick onClick="_gaTracker('send','event', .......
older but reliable way to do this
namecheap.com crazy88 domains
make shortest domains possible in print
then tack that landing page traffic
lot of tracking phone number services - lot to consider not going to make one reccomendation
types of testing
- A/B Testing 
Tools 
VWO
Optimizely
Hotjar for Heat Maps
helps understand the user experience
Test one thing at a time
Test something crazy once in a while.
Everyone’s market is different.
video recordings are his faovrites
bookings plugin example, people didn't realize had to use it differnt
real time and not just stats, real usabile actionalble data immediately to improve
site was beautiful but just not usable
Showed a hotjar demo
100 at a time, 
you do have to purge them
Shut up james, don't be lazy, do it right!

[How to Fire Yourself](https://2017.orlando.wordcamp.org/session/how-to-fire-yourself/)
[Andrew Norcross](https://twitter.com/norcross)

Used to have an agency
wanted people to hire in in spite of him
the work had to be good,
that worked
other goal reputation of company grew well beyond him
for a long time he was the one being hired, not the company
they pulled it off
200% growth
He walked away this spring
why?
growing and thier of clients involved way more work thet he was not well suited with
roles changed as they scaled
He loves writing code, not the things that come along with it
when he left he was exhausted, took time off
hard to do nothing
did not go in to fail or quit
did not prepare 
how many people know how much their company is worth?
how you gonna value the company?
valueations methods are going to come into play, decide before you are worth anything
maybe think trigger terms
hit X, exit
it was harder to leave than a divorce
you can quit your company by closing the company
he trusted his partner and let him take over
Legal, lot to consider
none of this is legal advice
you should have an attorney
thought through how they wanted to part
then took it to lawyer to sort out
If it isn't documented, it's up for debate
in this case did buy out
personal accountant got involved, protect from IRS
Taxes are a huge issue
had to make an s-corp
you can't remove primary from an s-corp without a lot og hurdles
Corp Amex can not remove owner either
The aftermath
how to plit up clients
he took 2 of the clients, everything else stayed with company
business bank account had issues
lot of mieutua but all important
you can be as public or as private as you want
they told employees first before anyone else
otherwise inviting trust issues and negative impacts
What about me?
do something for you, take tmie for yourself
disconnect
get to the little stuff around the house
Learned a lot throughout
lot to know
you don;t start with a business partner, you figure that out

[Becoming a Better Developer](https://2017.orlando.wordcamp.org/session/becoming-a-better-developer/)
[Micah Wood](https://twitter.com/wpscholar)

His stroy
grew landscaping company
martial arts shchool
before web dev
economy took a hit
lawnmowing took a hit
left with premium customers
sold those off
Developed and knew enough to get buy
but didn't feel he had what it took
but really everyoby has the ability to bigger things if you put your mind to it
today focuing on development
how to identify where you are at the moment and how to optimize your journey
that is the goal here
Dunning-Kruger Effect
bank rober was wearing invisible ink was surprised he got caught
do dumb pelple know they are stupid?
perceived ability vs perceived test score vs actual test scores
some people don't know they are better than they really are
New devs are often more confident that they should be
other end of the spectrum is imposter syndrome - expereinced devs are less confident than they should be
it takes competence to recognize competence
how do you know what you need to know without knowing what you need to know?
competence vs competence chart
peak early and then a low valley and then back up
I am new -> I am awesome -> I don't know what I am doing -> I got this
any time you learn something new, you are just imitating someone who already knows what they are doing
we don't really know yet
this phase brings a lot of enthusiasm
realize and recognize you are going to go through this curve
focus is the key to getting through this part
exposure vs engagement
good to get high level broad spectrum, but focus in and learn
what is silver bullet?  get through and start making money
there is no right answer though
you should have a path and be able to change it
go another route
Keep that focus (ford focus on screen)
need a good feedback loop
keep it local! 
have a good local dev environment
originally was just uploading everrything to see if works or not
then pulled it locally
then xdebug and stepped through line by line to understand solutions
but better understand exactly what WP even does
He used Google for everything
10 minute rule
if you don't find it in 10 minutes, likely there is not a good answer
maybe a simple dumb mistake on your end
reach out to friends, other devs
give it the full ol' college try, not just the high school try
imitate -> practice -> build (Uncertainty -> ...)
Focus-> feedback - > Collaborate
Pair programming is explaining why you think you need to do something
not as many people do this as they should
very effective way to learn
Code Reviews are a must!
You don't just ask someone to be your mentor
you should find a way to benefit them
trade and work it out with someone better at the thing you want to do than you are
imitate -> practice -> build (Uncertainty -> effiiency)
Focus-> feedback - > Collaborate -> automate, reuse
you spend 90% of your time readng code, messy code it harder to read and wastes times
clear as opposed to concise, concise can be less clear
and modularly reusing code
last step is Mastery
imitate -> practice -> build (Uncertainty -> effiiency) -> Master
Focus-> feedback - > Collaborate -> automate, reuse - > strategize
effectiveness
always goig to be a knowledge gap between what you want to know and what you know
giving talks is how he likes to learn
defining and sounding out why he does 
whole lot of diffrent things you can learn from different communities
Q&A comment - "Thank you, I don't feel alone in this anymore."  (WOW! what a comment)
