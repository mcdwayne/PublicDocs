[Imposter Syndrome: Stories from Two Different Perspectives](https://2018.phoenix.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-605)

Late,
Defining Imposter syndrome
Exercise to share with neighbor your experience feeling it
We ALL had stories
"Comparing the cutting room floor to the Sizzle reel"
Tech needs to know more than any one person Can know
WP community is great for knowledge sharing
Not just luck, Imposter Syndrome makes you think you are just lucky
IS is an act of violence to yourself
risk exposure
Stop playing safe
Greater risk is not knowing how capable and worthy you actually are
Q/A became people sharing stories
IS leads to Smartest guy in the room pissing contests
trying to look smart wastes time
Learn from students
Keep at it
What you have to do
Dev world is a big ocean
stay in the water until you master your lagoon
then swimming in other territories is so similar you can do it

[What The West Wing can teach us about building products](https://2018.phoenix.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-1446)
[AJ Morris](https://twitter.com/ajmorris)

5 steps of a product
Ideas
Plays example clip from THe West Wing
It was all about the ah-ha moment of 'I can fix that'
These ideas come at us from all over 
further clarity propels it forward
Going away and thinking about it and come back
Example idea he had
sending people coffee
sample subscription service is the idea
part of building product is clarifying the idea
if you move ahead too soon, will run into many issues
learn to say no to non formed ideas
You can have a lot of ideas, but they are all ideas
an understanding for a product needs more than that
enough clarity to move ahead
then Value Propositions.
Clear and up front
Examples
wp101 - learn WP the easy way
Provide enough clarity to make the defined end user clear
MVP!
What could we make at a mim to get our product to function to prove it is solving a problem
Unsplash MVP example
free 'stock' photos
3 hours from idea to MVP
tumbler + $20 theme
10 photos by local photographer
uploaded for free use
Traffic? hackernews post
2 hours later 20K downloads
free dropbox overwhelmed
over 2 million photos are downloaded a month
tested and validated very quickly
Replace viable product with viable value
if value then people will pay for it
Knowing what to build
start simple, single product
Don't do ti all at once
get it out the door asap
keep iterating, while constantly solving bigger issues
constantly communicate the vision of the grand problem to be solved
Ship it quick
product market fit means being in a god market with a product that can satisfy that market
Customer Feedback
surverys
feedback boxes
reaching out directly
users
usability testing

[Overcoming Your Fear of Sales](https://2018.phoenix.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-846)
[April Wier](https://twitter.com/WierApril)

It is terrifying to do sales because of fear of rejections
it is not just you, 80% of people also fear this
to solve this
Frist you got to get your mind right
Get over the idea of "I am bothering people"
Are you talking yourself out of sales? 
Stop being a credit manager
don't worry about if they seem like they should buy it
pool sales story
Pricing for what you think they can pay is all in your head
make more profit by charging what you are worth
In your head it is easy to only think about how the interaction will affect you
instead you need to focus on benefitting the client
Immersion therapy, must do this enough to get comfortable doing it
if it feels as scary every time like the first time you are not doing it enough
Do you want fries with that, repetition removes 
You job is not to sell, 
your job is to solve problems
Difference between 'do you want to buy' and 'how can I help'
For whom do you solve problems?
Not the universe
once you have clear vision of who has what pain points you can solve, it makes it easier
They need a trusted guide, make them look like a genius 
Ask about their business
Ask about their pain
Find what they didn't like about folks they DON'T buy from
find out what they like about folks they DO buy from
Listen to what they say when agitated
THEN you ge to talk
bend your story to their concerns
hustle and communication story
Classic Sales Techniques, updated for the digital age
Going out of business ->
I'm booking up quickly, I can only take on one more project
Foot in the door ->
Tripwire product, little thing you can sell them that establishes trust, selling a session to find what they need, Keyword research high value and builds trust
Stalking the Client ->
Continue to demonstrate the prospect's value to you
Sending article and stay top of mind without being annoying
He who talks first loses ->
Still works
What are some other old school techniques?
Make sure you are a fit
turn away business if bad fit
you want a relationship where you can make a difference
only so much time on the calendar
available start date = moving target
if they don't have time to meet, that is a giant red flag
flipside of scarcity is abundance,
there are many, many opportunities

[Yes, And: How improv basics build stronger teams, foster creativity and make the creative process more fun and less frustrating](https://2018.phoenix.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-878)
[Amber Pechin](https://twitter.com/AmberPechin)

(came in a tad late)
not about being funny
Learning some basic improv tools and muscles
4 rules of improv
1 Yes, And
2 Listen
3 No wrong answers
4 I got your back
Bonus rule
HAVE FUN
if it is not fun change what you are doing
creativity can be painful but it should eb fun pain
She started doing stand up
got told that the high of performing is like nothing else
chase that high of being in front of people
and through creativity
nailing specific goals
Changing from less about the me and all about the we
Interactive session!
[Alphabet game example](http://improvencyclopedia.org/games/Alphabet_Game.html)
You should know the rules 
Our job as creatives to to come the best idea
in business feels like competition to come up with best ideas
Goal is not be be funny yourself, but to make each other look funny
The most valiant thing you can do as an artist is inspire someone else to be creative
when everyone is winning the client is happy
no wrong answers - learning 
failure is opportunity in disguise
we are highly skilled at suppressing action, good improvisors develop action
when something seems off we stop exploring
the magic comes from going to explore an idea
we overthink our way out of acting
Listen!  It is super important
silence is golden
The third thing is usually the best idea, don't rush to fill the gaps
give the process space and time
it might be awkward at first
yes, and
the and is the hard part
Allowing people to operate without having to explain themselves constantly turns out to be like the rule of agreement in improv, it enables rapid cognition
think so fast you can build ideas
Need diverse thoughts and teams

periods of ideation and periods of feedback

everything exposes you as you push out the ideas
Imposter Symdrome - "I'm not good enough"
don't drop things you love because you are not a pro
don't stop doing art or sports or anything because you can't compete and have monitary value
