[Keynote: Build With the Community](https://2018.stlouis.wordcamp.org/session/keynote-build-with-the-community-how-the-power-of-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-build-and-contribute-to-some-of-the-largest-projects-in-wordpress/)
[Chris Wiegman](https://twitter.com/iqcomputing/status/995303602880237569)


The community is big
complex
lot of smaller communities within
Wordpress plugin to make my life easier
paid to maintain websites, 
dit it for himself
then uploaded and successful
really took off
scratched someone else's itch
Not a ton of other security at the time
was originally the only thing there really was
before wordfence
go big or go home
Release often
great code is great
but personal connection is best
put all the posts out you want, but knowing someone goes so far
Dont be afraid to say it
use your own voice
imposter syndrome
Community is great
But people do burn out
some people give everything
don't be afraid to ask for something back
take donations
be prepared to say NO!
Know when to ask for help
Caldera -Josh asked for help and it blew up successful this year
Keeping up with support requests
Don't underestimate how big community can get
pay attention to the data
pay attention
TEST THINGS
at least read your work and hire someone to read it before publishing
New features !== a better product
get involved!  First step is easy, meet people
Meetups, camps, you aleady took it be being here
Hallway track is super important

[WordPress, The GPL, & Ethics](https://2018.stlouis.wordcamp.org/session/wordpress-the-gpl-ethics/)
[Wolf Bishop](https://twitter.com/wptophat)

Basic rules:
Do not claim another's code as your own
Cite original
Do not released forked items unde r the same product name
if you modify GPL software, it must remain GPL
Dev edition:
Expect the product to be forked
accept that you are giving others permissions to redistribute your work
Do not whine when people give away your work, that is what you signed up for
What is forking?  
Modifying software into a new product regardless for public or private, free or paid
is forking Ethical?  YES! 
Examples:
WP - forked from B2
WooCommerce is a fork of Jigoshop
CMS Commander fork of ManageWO
WP Sync DB fork of WP Migrate DB
Pretty common process
GPL Clubs
a website that reditributes WP themes and plugins, usually for a monthly fee or one off purchase
are they ethical?  Yes
well....mostly. These operate outside the GPL do not last very long
activate a license as they are 
gpldl.com
gplguru.com
search 'gpl club'
Pros/Cons
cons - no support
no auto updates
Pros - Test premium plugins/themes on the cheap
Cheap premium plugins//themes
nobuda.com (sp?) only one that can autoupdate
basically fee marketing channel (if above board)
protecting yourself
Truly understand the GPL
Provide rockstar support
fair pricing
frequent updates are really key
release for free and charge for auto updates and support
His opinion:
Forking and GPL clubs are ethical and legal
devs who release under GPL must understand implications
Devs should release plugins/themes for free, but charge for support and auto-updates
End Users have a responsibility to understand the GPL

[GIT it under control: an introduction to GIT and code management](https://2018.stlouis.wordcamp.org/session/git-it-under-control-an-introduction-to-git-and-code-management-paul-f-gilzow/)
[Paul F Gilzow]()

Version Control System
not necessarily software
but git is software
Local, Central Destributed
local VCS
examples dates directories and or fies
revision control system
advantages: cheap, simple easy to work with
Disadvantage: collaboration can be difficult
error prone
can't work offline
Central
Subversion
Advantage: Collaboration much easier
Everyone knows where the lastest version is
more control over who has access
everyone can clearly see what everyone else is working on
Disadvantage:
single point of failure
you can't commit changes if you don't have access (no offline)
can be slow
Destributed
Peer to peer version
everyone has their own complete copy of the repo and exchange patches.
Advantages
Collab is easy
every clone is full copy
you can work offline
local changes/commits can be made, history maintained without having to share with anyone until you are ready
common operations are fast
permissions are lightweight
Disadvantages
Every clone is a full repo copy 
does not handle bianary files well
no built in error handling
management permissions are lightweight
Git advantages:
Everything is local / the ability to work offline
branching is easy and really really fast and easy
disadvantage
can be confusin
does not impose a specific workflow
CLI based, though not always intuative
145 commands in git
access control is read or notread
Does not support empty directory
What is GitHub? (or bitbucket, GITLab, Gogs, Gilea, etc)
Git Basics and Terms
everything starts with git
GUI is available
git --help
branch (the noun) not the verb
default new repo has master
but names do not matter
branches are unlimited
start from a specific history in an existing branch
Branching is BIG
you can have your own little universe to experiment in
freeing!
clone
create a copy locally and track changes against the remote
HEAD - the current branch
Working Tree
The files you are working on
Normally contains the contents of the HEAD, plus any changes you have but not committed
there is only one working directory, if you switch branches, GIT replaces 
Index
where things live
Status, tells you what is going on in the world
add
commit
store all the contents of the index and a message
how the file changed
a reference back to the commit it came from
an ID (hash)
pull gets it from remote into working tree
merge
