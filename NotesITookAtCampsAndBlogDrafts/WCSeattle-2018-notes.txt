Coffee

Coffee was standard fair, but given the quality of the stuff that Seattle is known for, it felt sub par. There were bagels and breads along with a toaster to toast those items as well as fruit.  Pretty good spread overall.

[Keynote: Bridget Willard â€“ Community: Observe, Include, Accept](https://2018.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/keynote-bridget-willard-community-observe-include-accept/)
[Bridget Willard](https://twitter.com/YouTooCanBeGuru)

Community is important
Community is a Verb
We make up Reasons and reasons not to go to events
is this really another Community talk?
Community is like Oxygen on an airplane
you don't miss it until it is gone
She went hiking high elevation, was not used to it,
friend was
Community is social science
not a time wasting fluff
Unfortunately, we are all human beings
we are hard wired to connect with other humans
when we are deprived of it it affects our lives
everything that matters to people is a verb
* Observe
* Include
* Accept
We say we belive in inclusion until we don't
iphone vs android example
meetup attendance is low or just talking to same people, it is on us to be the ones who do the outreach
Be the cultivator of the garden
you don't just plant and walk away
Observing who is there and how they are
our body language tells all
Maybe you came here alone
meet the people around you
easy and feels good
include
conversation with person in audience
sometimes it is just good to hear it
psychological safety
that is what friends are and need it to exist
we don't celebrate what makes us different, but what makes us the same
focus on the venn diagram
Accept
it is up to us to reach out to bring them in
build bridges , don't destroy them
we make emotional decisions and then go to google to justify them
we should be making rational decisins
she is always having to defend Marketing as science
reading data and reacting in real time
it is real science
hard to be different
walked into WC LAX 2015 
Alex V asked her to volunteer as social media person
she would have never volunteered on her own
would you like to ___
ask.  
read bios and ask them if they 
Cortisol is the stress hormone
it is what drives fight or flight instinct
if you are 
Grooming and calm is oxytocin
this is the chemical that makes us feel calm and accepted
lowers cortisol
Embrace yourself as yourself
don't just assimilate
don't lose who you are
diversity of thought is key to growing the community
the way we have the conversation makes the difference
Why do we have a lego piece?
We are built to be connected
is it the wrong peice?  is it the wrong time?
invest in people and they will invest in you
you don't know when you will need that peice
the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago
2nd best time is now
it is not just random legos
is one of you doesn't participate we can't build the plane
the actual lego plan
we need a revival of this community
we already have early adopters and innovators
if we want to get to the next level, 51%+
we need to see the arguments don't matter
we need to get together
you have friends

[What I Learned From Interviewing 200+ People in WordPress](https://2018.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/kyle-maurer-what-i-learned-from-interviewing-200-people-in-wordpress/)
[Kyle Maurer](https://twitter.com/MrKyleMaurer)


A few years ago, wanted to dig in a little more
on Google+ someone said they were starting a WP show
co-hosted WP RoundTable 
he was only constant host
Never repeated a guest
talked one on one about community
learning things about them
Learned a lot about
Succeeding in WP
The People of WP
and himself
we all want to feel like Cheers
instead we all feel like the first day of school
we feel like we are minor part 
learning to fit in
you can fit in, just need to find a place
scheduling with guests forced him to honor the commitment
schedule with a pen, not a pencil
Published > Perfect
but quality compromises limit growth
could have done it better, but learned to be at peace with the fact it was done
comparing the diffs between what they expected to get out of it vs what they did
they wanted: 
traffic, views, an audience, notoriety
sponsors, recognition
THat they got:
Relationships
Confidence
interviewing skills
advice
valuable lessons
contacts
great stories
credibility
What he learned about the people of WP
reflects his networks and himself
he is a profile
The WP "Industry" is still very young
WP space has not been around a long time
self employed 58.2%
Employed 41.7%
many small players
bigger players begin to grow
market itself consolidates
still a gender gap, in all of tech
Stats for turnover rates
1 year 30%
2 years 24%
3 years 33%
4 years 34%
younger people change jobs more frequently
lot of business acquisitions as well
Age gaps, big time
Guest age range
teens 1.8%
20s 5.4%
30s 64% 
40s 24.0
50s 4.2%
60s 0.6%
now this reflects his experience
and kind of self selecting
We are established but still new, so Enterprise business stats don't apply
but it is not the new thing
many of the 30s folks started with the 'hot new thing' when they were in 20s
right place at right time
The non-US community is very underrepresented
guest locations is almost all US based
only a few other countries represented on the show
General observations
Everyone says "I got into this accident"
College experience was common - rarely related to WP though
a previously unrelated career was common
Many are taking a break from travel
when WP was taking off and WordCamps were new, lof o early adopters went to as many events as they could
burn out is real
reflects the age group, homes and kids and other pressing responsibilities
Almost everyone was self taught
WordCamps were a huge turning point for many people
special moment that changed their lives
how welcoming and supportive
What he learned about succeeding in WP
Super common advice
- Specialize - be super good at something
- charge more
undercharging really plagues the space
- just ship it! - more important to release than getting it perfect
- know when to give up
move on when it is time
- Good communication solves most problems
- Engage the community - the community will help if you let them
Common factors in major "success" stories
- Start early, some of it is just right time and right place
- Failed over and over - the most successful peple fail more
- Had funding or at least a financial cushion
- Worked their tails off
Bonus: reiterating his favorite points
Trick yourself into being consistent 
WP is maturing and really changing, so must our strategies
We need to work harder on Diversity
This community will change your life if you let it
If you are not successful enough yet, keep failing, you have not failed enough to succeed

[User Experience and Branding for WordPress sites](https://2018.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/user-experience-and-branding-for-wordpress-sites/)
[Jennifer McKnight](https://twitter.com/promogurl)

Story of her dress
it is crochet
Passion for content
websites before 
in 2000 websites were about utility
it was a service to make things easier to find
in around 2009 social media really transformed the expectations of what the internet did
in 2010 she took on her first website client
Idaho Beef
had no web presence, he didn't have time
he was busy with beef stuff
Even small businesses need to be brand and UX
A brand is more than a "thing" 
we do use brands as items a lot though
A brand is tied to perception
it is how you feel about the product or service
A brand can be defined, but it is difficult
You can impact your brand with web design
Video elements with real people in them
characters that personify human qualities
Aesthetics that elicit emotions  
Advertising
In store experience
Visual identify
Websites are one of the most effective ways to prpmot 
UX if everything
rooted in existentialism
Tied to emotions and attitudes
Separate from usability
UX is what the user does on the wide
usability is how easy it is to use
The code of UX is ensuring that users find value in what you are providing them
Ask about
Useful?
desirable?
Findable?
Accessible
Credible
Tools that help create branded WP sites
Slickplan
better site maps and content planning
Yoast
for better SEO
make sure people are seeing the right meta
Admin Custom Login
Google Analytics
Slider Revolution

[With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility](https://2018.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility/)
[Chris Teitzel](https://twitter.com/technerdteitzel)

---late----
What happens when the democracy has bad actors
the rules get changed to let them shut it down
who watches the watchers?
banning Alex Jones is good but who watches that and says it is OK
with big data there is a responsibility with all that
Strava
tracking yourself 
released heat maps of running and hiking and biking
accidentally published the locations of secret military bases
strava.com/heatmaps
What are the unintended consequences of what I built?
Collectively big data is starting to know more about us than we know about us
the "Target" pregnant daughter story
customer ID for baby items online or in store tied to credit card
Looked at history to build a 'pregnancy store'
lax sense of communications
folling law but still creepy
Facebook can detect depression slides
built some suicide helpline stuff in
Memories feature, cool for a lot of things
"sick and tired of getting reminded of my son's suicide"
how can we prevent some of these abuses
23andMe
people using ancestry sites to track down more cold case suspects
selling data to cancer drug makers
really cool stuff
but scary since can't control where your data goes or how it is used
80/20 Paradox
If we build for the 80%
What about the 20% and the 1%
Tech has the power to change millions of lives. for the better or the worse
homeless app to help discover services
computers are only as smart as the person programming them - his dad
We have the power to change millions of lives
What are you doing to protect ALL your users
Privacy as a community responsibility
Sometimes we need a nudge
GDPR 
US and EU  views
Free speach as a right vs privacy as a right
Data belongs to the owner vs data belongs to the subject
opt out vs opt in
people fear gov'ment and trust businesses vs People trust gov and fear business
Litigation is the first resort vs litigation if all else fails
WP and Drupal
WP privacy in core Drupal it is contrib
how do we adopt common best practices across the web and 
John Eckman's Taking back what and from whom?
Contract for the Web core principals (recently published)
as a company, as a gov as a citizen
good framework
WP is leading privacy in CMS
Open Web Privacy Working Group
seems altruistic 
but the opposite is we stay reactive and are not part of the conversation when policy if formed

[Increase Productivity in Big and Small Ways](https://2018.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/increase-productivity-in-big-and-small-ways/)
[Rhonda Negard](https://twitter.com/fatdogcreatives)

Make your bed
one task done
et up for success
solutions are about how you operate, not just in your machine
looked at goals and worked backwards in planning
met goals nd some 6 months early
but before that, was not organized
car was messy
worked to understand system processes and improvements
swipe files
streamlining the process to help overcome time management and emotional/mental blocks
streamlining means making templates
ID own process with a client or project
Create all items, scripts, and plans in that process
save these in a place and an order that makes sense
Not everyone...
calls, emails, text, meet
people communicate differently
clients don't need to be super organized because she is organized
thats another opportunity
services and rates to account for client needs

[Clone Yourself Through Automation](https://2018.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/clone-yourself-through-automation/)
[Jocelyn Mozak](https://twitter.com/JocelynMozak)


Form automation
make sure you are doing it correctly and automatically every time
Project automation
launch and 1 month later "Testimonial"
30 days later
updating and maintenance plans
3 months out referrals
6 moths and 1 year anniversary
celebrate 9 months
but where do I start?
Canned emails
templates in gmail, just save it
post launch
Active Campaign example
Zapier (Action happens, triggers another thing)
+ gravity forms
clear system of folders
connected 
client 1 project 1
client 2 ...
active, name of client, project
move to dropbox
Zapier connects more than 1000 apps
More Efficiency tips
declutter your inbox
auto scan and sort is good, but 
make sure new shiney objects are dealt with systematically not as distractions
Key Qualification questions baked into auto email templates
what is your budget and investment?
Set example sizes of budgets to set expectations
gets rid of tire kickers and keeps your time freer
Get your tool set dialed in
themes and plugins ready to go
don't need to play in experimental new stuff all the time, find what works
only use hosts you know and love
she uses WPEngine
Continue to automate, if you do it twice, start thinking if you will do 3rd time
if do a third time, automate it and never do it manually again
It is a bit like teaching your kids to tie their own shoes
there is an up front cost, but you will celebrate every time someone ties their own shoes
Tool list
you need to know your numbers and your business
some expenses are good
