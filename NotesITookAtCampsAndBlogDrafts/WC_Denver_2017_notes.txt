[Keynote: The Future of WordPress](https://2017.denver.wordcamp.org/speakers/#wcorg-speaker-zack-katz)
[Zack Katz](https://twitter.com/zackkatz)
Gravity View, Small team, 5 people all over the world
WP makes it happen
History of WP
His WP story
Future of WP and You
A fun surprise

In 2003 Ma.tt was a college student
lot of photos
B2 - was cool, allowe to be upated
B2 maintainer dissapeared and it stop being updated
Matt could either wait for the dev to come back or he could take b2 and make it his own
Mike Little thought one or 2 people might be interested :)
Zack started in 2007 making GravityViews
worked at Fast Signs
learned how to do web design, PHP and mySQL
best tool was his phone
he cold called and got clients
was building static pages
and clients wanted to change content themselves
they wanted a way to manage their content, CMS
Then clients wanted custom functionality
the custom code he built became Gravityviews
he has 38 plugins on wp.org
Future of WP
Matt is pushing us back to be the best in publishing
Gutenberg: from text to blocks
blocks are consistent interface for all the elements of your site
everything is a block now
Gutenberg demo
feels normal and cool
It is the future of content editing
The Customizer is how to change view
Not much at the moment, but future is how to interact with your site
Edit existing content with customizer soon
Really cool live preview demo
Customizer Change set have multiple people and multiple changes scheduled at once
this is 4.9 core!
Implications: page building is in core now
for Page builders need to either embrace customizer or do their own thing
get involved now with Gutenberg, this is the future
and there is a lot more
The four freedoms of Open Source
the contract of using WP
1) the freedom to run the program in any way you want
2) you can study code and change it
3) share it 
4) modify and fork with a diffrent name

[What I Wish Iâ€™d Known About Freelancing](https://2017.denver.wordcamp.org/session/what-i-wish-id-known-about-freelancing/)
[Nathan Ingram](https://twitter.com/nathaningram)

You don't have to know everything, no one does!
Become a person who is good to know!
Stay out of debt
Checklist manifesto
Put everything in a list in order and that means you can streamline
and when you onboard people, you have process you can pass on
difference between owning job and building business
Focus on process, not heroics
There are seasons in freelance work, don't waste the slow times
We stay in a cycle of stress, must make best use of time and dont freak out
business will come back
The 'someday list' when slow times come, you can do that list!
being busy is not a badge of honor
Don't forget what matters in life, 
lost opportunities for family and friends don't come back
midset shift that it is good to be too busy to have leisure, a status symbol
People are more import than projects!

[After the Post: SEO, Images, and Meta Descriptions](https://2017.denver.wordcamp.org/session/after-the-post-seo-images-and-meta-descriptions/)
[Mendel Kurland](https://twitter.com/ifyouwillit)

Technical SEO fo to Yoast
instead we are going to be talking about 
3 things
1) being descriptive and interesting
Writing for humans, conversational and eas to read, some 
basics of story anatomy
Tells a story and then explained the story arc
also is an article part
intro to a topic H1, H2, H3

2) Enjoyable and illustrative

shows progress form boring Lorum Ipsum -> Bacon Ipsum - pic -> animated gif
more info
more interesting to look at better for SEO
generate this stuff 

3) making things sharable
click to sweet, share icons
basic plugins
write your own meta, just gives you control, not SEO tip
