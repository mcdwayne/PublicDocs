[The Future: Why Open Matters](https://2017.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/the-future-why-open-matters/)
[Aaron D. Campbell](https://twitter.com/aaroncampbell)

QBasic Gorillas was his intro to open code
breaking it and shift-f5 to compile

Bernard of Chartres - dwarves perched ont he shoulders of giants
Start by building on what was already there
Issaac Newton Paraphrased 1675
If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants
Waitbutwhy website
groth of knowledge before language
how tribal knowledge works
generational
pre-language was very slow
post-language amount of knowledge grew exponentially
The internet is the single most effective information sharing tool in all of history.
open systems have some dangers
Closed systems are owned by companies and they control the data
they will only do things that benefit them as a company, not really a bad thing
If don't like it leave
Net Neutrality
closed systems sit on top of the web, Net Neutrality is really about the way the core of the internet works
lot of separate networks joined together, is basically how it still works
Let's talk about the ideal, not the legislation
Treat all data the same
Historically sometimes common knowledge gets it wrong and only a smal group gets it right early
if we don't allow everyone the same voice online, can stop this from happening
taking away people's right to make decisions by force is wrong, is it also just as bas to prevent them from learning a thing?
_The internet is not the future_
The internet sets us up for a better future
What can we do?
	Use Open Platforms
	spread the word - many people don't know this is important, tell them
	Vote - Be Informed
	Vote with your $$$

[Using WordPress As A Decoupled CMS For A Single Page Application](https://2017.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/off-with-its-head-using-wordpress-decoupled-cms-for-single-page-application/)
[Treighton Mauldin](https://twitter.com/Treighton1988)

THe orignal stack
LAMP
JS

The issue - lot of bloated AJAX calls
Lot of load in and too many AJAX calls!
Fighitng around the templates an issue

decided to build a devloper specific single page
Used the Rest API

WordCamp Plug: 1:40 on REST API
He is not talking about RESTAPI dev, just using it
React is all JS
ES6 syntax
just normal JS though
In REACT pass everything as props
map over them in an artifact compmenet,
on individual article pages just pull in the content 
Can server side render JS so it loads faster

Rest API lets you very quicky make 'endpoints' 
allows you to just get the info quickly, without pulling all the normal post metadata


[Distribute Allthethings: WordPress And The Era Of Multiple Content Channels](https://2017.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/distribute-allthethings-wordpress-and-the-era-of-multiple-content-channels/)
[Jake Goldman](https://twitter.com/jakemgold)

Distribute all the things, 
big enough to conquor any problem, small enough to care

Why is this important?
10UP tells stories with digitial media
thinking about how you telling their story
Traditional as well print and network news media
newer brands like the Oprah 
odern Digitial First as well - 538

From their infrastructure to their audience and rev team, thiniing that when the digital publishers succeed, they succed.


Encyclypedias Britanica and Encarta
things changes underneath them

conpect os putting your content in multiple channels is not new
Associated Press, special access needed, lexus nexis and similar followed
Early was just another way reletively basic secondary channel
'web specials'
email news distribution, RSS, WAP, low bandwidth
the App era started desktop channels
then RSS extends, XML RPC, JSON
not just platforms like iPhones, but accelerating with special platforms, like CRMs 
interoperability is the key
roughly now
Jakes 2 axis paradigm for modern distribution channels
Axis 1
the open web has turned to crap and we can do better but same thing, (evolution) 
A resonse to (revolutions)
Axis 2 
open - different ways
constrained - best to let us control the content
as move from LL to UR
complexity increases but opportunity grows
this is not static, always shifting
newpapers changed the world, completely open when new
now pretty standard, not even really evolving
TV same thing
then the way things have been done
html5 represents web technologies
but not the futre, iteration
Kindle tried
Apps thinks there is a lot of room in space for opportunity
youtube, constrained but right in between evo and revolution
AR and VR is the most open right now, newest frontier, most complex though
where does the digitial CMS fit in?
First web CMS as give requirements to devs, they build it
next build a text editor that does not need human element
the CMS as the hub of a multichannel strategy
next thing for CMS is to solve for this problems

MUST have a good writing experience for the CMS 
Ecosystem of third party integrations
API and data accessability
trend is only accelerating
and increasingly proprietary
ecosystem of integrations is even more important!

what does this mean for the future
review: yesterday solving for content creation, organization storage and presentation
channels pull out presentation layer
editors are pullnig out the content creations
the future is very focused on storage and API and daata cassability
nobody really creates in the CMS directly anymore
as the channels converge in engagement levels, do we spend time in the CMS worrying about the final 'design' of content?  
nope
standardized template will be norm

1) presentation layer and content creation is less relevant, how to sort is more important
editorial UX is higher value than rendering
2) extensability is vital
3) custom is crazy, economies of scale apply
appresser
mobiloud
wordapp
these are vibrant in the ecosystem, many options!
watch for new announcement of tools from providers/companies like google
will mention WP a lot
4) Platform and content control is even more important
with private players competing to 'own' consumption, an open platform protects publishers from third party business interests and choices
(what swould happen if Apple bought Medium)
Q&A: ulitmately Gutenberg will be less relevant as we move away from content creation in the CMS
don't fragment your channel unless segmentation is obviously a right move


[Coding For The Masses](https://2017.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/coding-for-the-masses/)
[Justin Busa](https://twitter.com/mrjustinbusa)
...Limit the frequency of large releases 
minor releases, patch release
upers want to update with confidence
pushing minor updates withm more frequency and less content
don't include too many releases in minor releases
do updates on Tuesday or Wednesday
Foster an ecosystem by providing APIs
Make docs available
write celan code thats easy to read and follow
Make your code base public and accept pull requests from others
Don't pass the buck

New features
be selective with the features that you ass
build things that help solve your user needs
too many features can make a product hard to use
new features directly impact support
don;t add a feature just beacuase someone else did

Day 2

[WordPress Performance â€“ Foundation and Tactics](https://2017.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/wordpress-performance-foundation-and-tactics/)
[Matt Vanderpol](https://twitter.com/bookwyrm)

Creating time, not for you, but for your users, not ust better for your page rank, better for you users
Research for 
https://squirrelwp.com/
Overview, perf-matters.squirrelwp.com/ as a Concrete example
rickety foundation means bad site
need  good foundation
Fast web request compenents
fix different parts, need to understand them
Analytics is a good place to start
benchmark of where people are coming from, all the details effect performance
Lot of tools for this, like Pingdom, Google Pagespeed, etc
problems on these tools
a single set of hueristics, 
gives you a score which may or may not represent website performance
WebpageTest.org is the one he likes best, using it for this presenation
he thinks it is best because:
1) real world test
2) actual devices used
3) Change parameters, like locations, what kind of network, types of networks, etc taylor to your real analytics, first view only or repeat to test caching
4) film strip output, frame by frame breakdown
5) Test history
you can run your own private instance if you want
Negatives:
it is a free service, you will likely be in a queue
hard to quantify a score, does not give a one true score
Now, looking at WPT output to see how and what to fix
some scores
some metrics 1000 is the minimu, this is not really time, but close
waterfall chart is the key otput
content breakdown, everything that is not html
image analysis - taking it with a grain of salt, resolution not certain
always double check your analytics for tuning to your real users
Waterfall - graphical representation of all events that it takes to display a web page
Vertical lines are events
after DOM is loaded then JS starts chrning
DOM = document object model
events - window.load and width of vertical line where it starts and how long it took
JS execution length is important to note
A good reccomendation is run a test on the theme demo site when selecting themes
Tactics:
Time ti first byte TTFB
this is tme for browser to make request, resolve DNS, transfer HTML to browser, firsst byte hits that is TTFB
caching fill make this fast after this point
cache later in process, it can obscure other data points when you are tuning
static content not cached
may be difficult to 
(most of room not using a CDN in any way, 1/2 knew what it was)
long waterfall example
This is best way to keep checking if changes makes impact
Optimizing images will speed things up
should be optimizing your images
bigger issue is content images
concatenate resources, might not always speed things up, good case for checking with waterfall
page cache with WPRocket does a lot of other things like concat resourced automatically
browser can not do anything until it gets the HTML, best interest to get all the HTML as small as you can
CDN - he likes KeyCDN and Cloudflare
browser caching
lazy load images
http/2 - very common now, allows parallelism, multiple JS files can be loaded in parallel
Summary - analyze, fix, test, tweak, test


[Demystifying WordPress Multisite: When Is Multisite A Good Choice And When Is It Not?](https://2017.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/demystifying-wordpress-multisite-when-is-multisite-a-good-choice-and-when-is-it-not/)
[Mike Fitzpatrick](https://twitter.com/fitzpatrick)
First 15 sites on MultiSite right after it made it into core
very opinionated talk on what he will and not do with WP-multisite
should you use it or not
1/3 of room has used MultiSite
Don't use MS if...
too many plugins
350 car dealers on single MS - individual plugins on each site, test bed
200 plugins at one point, a mess
nightmare to administor
make it for one use case and one use case only
this is why WP.com is only for blogs
Do use it when you have a siloed use case and want to have repatable sites creation process and management
more time to deliver functionality, easier to scale within silo
trage offs: with their use case each new fnctionality they wanted would spin out site into its own site, charge for it, then manage one off as a seperate site
domain structure
Subdomain vs path based
he has never found a reason to use folder/subdirectory path, he always used subdomains
actively have to research and pick your path

Setting up MS
deactivate all plugins
add MS in core, wp-config
adds network setup under tools
install gives you code to copy/paste into wp-config and htaccess file
point domains
wildcard
going to need to put a way to add a way for wildcarding to work, have to do it under subdomains
Roles whithin Multisite
car dealer is the typical client, they will break things if you give them the chance
give people the least amount of access possible to begin with and let them ask for more
superadmin role is unique to MS
give roles some serious thought
2 ways to deal with Plugins
network activate
or not
There are some reasons to not network activate, for example , slider plugin if you change on one site can be added to all of them, make sure you are sure if multisite compatible
other reason to not network activate is if you are looking to monitize
want to charge more for plugin/functionality, do it on a per request
or use plugins that allow for pay path to get the functionality
Plugins
admin plugins
	which plugins are activated on which sites
	site creation plugins
	backup plugins
		network or individual sites
Anti-splog (name of a plugin to prevent bots from building fake sites)
monitize plugins
	charge for functionality, etc.
Ect, ect
gravityforms
	add on new user
Admin menu pro
WPMUdev
	new blog templates
Domain Mapping - abc.com - 123.abc.com - want to point jsmith.com - when request jsmith.com directs to 123.abc.com
Snapshot WPMU dev
	backup individusl sites
Updraft
WPEngine
shared hosting - hostgator
reseller perspective - really quick to pick up sites that fall over, shared hosting isn't that bad
from a cost perspective - make sure one install is one MS, WPEngine works this way
WPE is shared hosting on basic packages, but offers Dedicated solutions
