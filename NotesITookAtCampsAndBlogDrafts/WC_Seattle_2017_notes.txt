#####Keynote 

[WordPress is a Banquet](https://2017.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/keynote-wordpress-is-a-banquet/)
[Andrea Middleton](https://twitter.com/andmiddleton)

Most people are surprised that this freee software runnign 28% of the interenet is made by community
lot of people wr=ork on WP but no one works for WP
Goes over the teams
Looks like a lot of plates
o a table
like a banquet
it is , each of us bring something to create something bigger than ourselves
Not going to talk about the eating part - the using
talk about contributing and the recipes
and what some contributors have found works
One of the goals 
I couldn't do that fallacy
	I can't write code so I can't contrib
3 stories of contributors with no code!
	there is some secret people or unusual attributes required
She wants to show the source code of contributions
humans made of human stuff
1 - James Huff
2004 - Lost and House re new, flip phones, ipods are new
James working at a feed store
macmanx news site
wanted blogs, movable types
james didn't like it, minor things got on his nerves
WP 1.2
hit bug
answered a few questions on install
he liked helping people
he learned in the process
I learned most of wht I know today by researching answers for questions I thought were really cool
User: Can I display only one category on my front page?
Me: Wow, that sounds cool! Let's find out!
Became a moderator when unemployed 
went to work for WP.com
happiness engineer
49,000 replies on the support forums!
start by focusing on what you know, not what you don't know. 
You know something that someone does not know of the forums, even if you just installed WP
Patience
Willingness to help others
Dedication to the project over your own needs
Petya Raykovska
2007
Superbad, iPhone and FB premeired
She was marketing manager for publishers
set up a blog
WP let her do things that until then took a dev to do
in 2011 started a web agency
translated stuff into Bulgarian
she learned a lot about WordPress
she got in deep in a way she 
Eventually met the head of translations at WCEU
Editing the Codex
just gave her a page to edit, she did, and she realized at that table of international people
part of something huge that mattered
She ended up running the team
in 2015 polyglots went to translating 30,000 projects
still needed more people
Stayed for the people
they came up with WP Global translation day
the last one was the biggest and she didn't have a direct hand, she passed it on
it will be bigger than you
Curiosity, Respect and patience a
Bridget Willard
in 2007
Was working at the office manager for contractor firm
WP.com blog personally
in 2008 economy crash - crushed construction market
Started a blog for company and didn't tell her boss
she ran it on her own
they let her
no tech background, she had a relentless curiosity
networking for a lot of social media
brought in work
undervalued
she had 20K followers, which is crazy good for a construction company
First wordcamp in 2013
Side note - Keeping the price low for WC helps keep it accessible and growing
Anyhow 
Bridget kept building and learning and blogging about her user experiences
by end of 2015 she got a job at a plugin
she found her tribe
I got a shout out :)

[Accelerating Custom Development with Dynamic Scaffolding and WP-CLI](https://2017.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/accelerating-custom-development-with-dynamic-scaffolding-and-wp-cli/)
[Ben Byrne](https://twitter.com/drywall)

real name of talk:
Come hear about this neat thing we built
building good stuff fast is the issue at hand
Want to keep affordable, non-profit
custom sites, can take a lot of time and effort
A lot of people immediatly got o premium themes
overblown for some use cases
hard to maintain sometimes, bugs and troubleshooting
sometimes very hard to coustomize
Starter themes
+ component libraries are another approach, 
preferred way for a lot of people
but at Cornershop
lot of institutional knowledge
hard to maintain library if you are doing a lot
plus all the copy and pasting
Dynamic scaffolding
for their starter theme
fancy way of copying things and configuring them as they set them
warning: your milage may vary, not a best practices talk
just ideas around efficient workflows they have experienced
First goal is to speed develpment
also easy for new folks to learn
theme should hae everything it needs and NOTHING IT DOES NOT - clean code
Avoid reinventing the wheel
avoid tedious, repetitive work (e.g. copy/past)
WP-CLI is the cornerstone of the their work
Broad support and awareness
already offers scaffolding
supports Mustache templating
Easy documentation! - no sperate help docs, all in tool
WP-CLI scaffold child theme
plugin
post-type
taxonomy - outputs you have to STOUD
theme-tests - build s a bunch of files
_s
They extended it
built Produce (it could be a package as well)
It extends wp-cli with a new command and subcommands
then run, commande inject code into our starter theme, Crate
Basic flow
Make sure starter theme is present
install & Acivte Produce plugin
Run WP-CLI commands
...
Example
customize the admin login
manually it is cumbersome
Quick command lines to automate adding new logo and changing background!
other subcommands
wp produce site-options (bundle of fields they commonly mod)
term-fields - acf fields builder
articles gives you a new post type
10 commands now and still growing
lot of ideas in queue
architecture - 
base class with methods, variables and helpers to facilitate building commands
subdirectorie for a lot fo things
articles files commands/articles
more
mustache templates
automatic support for WP-CLI is part of why they like it
template with some PHP and CSS
4 variables injected
mustache is name of curly brackets for simple templates
commands are straightforward to extend and build
__invoke is what gets triggered when you type a command
you can skip things that are not needed when you enqueue things
Don't touch non-generated fields! 
makes it way easier to customize bu standardizing what they can touch

[Stronger Than Fear: Mental Health in the Developer Community](https://2017.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/stronger-than-fear-mental-health-in-the-developer-community/)
[Edward Finkler](https://twitter.com/funkatron)
[OS Mental Illness](https://twitter.com/OSMIhelp)

this talk if for the people who work with tech
How many people wear glasses?
Are you comfortable talking to your co-workers about glasses?
How about diving?  Talking about it?
Cancer? 
Mental health? A larger number than he thought would
talk about your own mental health
difference between talking about mental and physical health
Generailized anxiety disorder - flight or fight is extreme in non extremem situation
like a lion going to eat you is OK to have reaction
but how about buying lunch?
Walking into a new bar for the first time
overwhelms
ADHD - low frustration threshold - tem minute "snit fit" when things go poorly
good at constructing false situations in his mind,  
Therapy helps - talks about how and why he does the things he does
some of this is advantageous to his job
security issues, empathizing with users
able to make disperate connections faster
it can take everything from you though
hospitalized and had to do outpatient therapy
forced him to quit a job
had o step away from stuff that is normal for him
Feeling alone is a real part of it
especially in a crowd
depression kicks in
afraid of people getting tired of him and leaving
lot of people feel that way as well
that is what we are fighting
WHO study - burden of mental disorders is largest in North Maerica accross all acatogies
People do not feel they can talk to their peers or employers about mental health
most people think it would affect their careers
there is some evidence that there is more mental health issues with tech professionals
Sick workers don't work
it benefits the org to have better employees
mental wellness = better employees
people want to work with people who respect them fully
1. Get the OSMI handbooks for free 
ebooks on getting your workplace improved
2. Speak openly about Mental Health subjects
you have a lot of influence o the community around you
you would be surprised how many people open up if you open us first
3. Tell people that they matter
we are social creatures and need affirmation
those are tings you can do
we are talking about our colleagues and friends
suffer in silence
some disappear
and we are left to wonder and regret and try to understand
Fear is the only thing that allows this
we have to choose
give in to fear and be quiet, it is easier
pretend it does not happen
meet inaction with action
meet confusion with understanding
meet indifference with compassion
Yes, we need you, lot to do, go check out the

[What WordPress is Doing to Keep Your Site Safe](https://2017.seattle.wordcamp.org/session/what-wordpress-is-doing-to-keep-your-site-safe/)
[Aaron Campbell](https://twitter.com/aaroncampbell)

Talks about what you have to do
this talk is about that WP is doing for the user
Goal is not really site secure, it is keep users secure
makes what they are doing more difficult than just the site
security team 
50 volunteers
most have day jobs around security
Code review is def part of it
constantly changing 
bad actors are always coming up with new ways to break things
bug bounty program https://hackerone.com/WordPress
a secure, safe way to surface and fix issues
some real successes with it already
increased number of reported issues
reporters feel appreciated
paid out about $12K in bounties
average bounty $350
better tools HackerOne - used to be an email chain
make sure it is fixed right the first time thanks to testing
there has been some struggles too
only about 16% of reports are valid
information overload, 5 out of 6 are invalid
high touch - lot more time per ticket
time is the limiting factor they struggle with the most
some things we do better than other projects
Relationships
plugin devs
can help 
Hosts
WAFs
able to help protect WP sites before the actors ever hit the site itself
want to protect millions of sites thanks to WAFs and Hosts
4.7.2 - millions sites protected before there was even an issue
does not want it to be a fair race, lets get a head start on security
they are pretty good at that
Automatic updates are fast
tens of thousands of updates a minute
If you are turning off auto updates OK if you got 24/7 staff working with host, that is reasonable
But if you don't have staff and turned them off from fear o site breaking, that is bad
99.9% of new updates success
.001% failure rate
rest are retrys
you are far more likely because you were late on updating to get hacked than have a broken site
and with that Q&A

DAY 2 CONTRIBUTOR TRACK


Picture Perfect: Getting Beautiful Images Without Violating the Law
[Timeca Briggs](https://2017.seattle.wordcamp.org/speaker/timeca-briggs/) 
[Zainab Hussain](https://2017.seattle.wordcamp.org/speaker/zainab-hussain/) 
[Christine Winckler](https://2017.seattle.wordcamp.org/speaker/christine-winckler/)
[Lisa Stewart](https://2017.seattle.wordcamp.org/speaker/lisa-stewart/)


Copyright vs copywrong
Copyright is the legal right
exclusive, yo have the right to use and distribute the image 
exclusive but not absolutethey do expire, then go to public domain
copywrong
cr not to ideas just the specific written down thing
copyright is not universal, it is territorial
 Copywrite is automatic without registering
 but registering makes it way easier to prove you have the rights
 also registered lets you get damages above normal damanages 
How to find the images
think about what you really need, too tall/too short, what do you need it for and costs
THink about compelling compsition
this can subjective, go back to your style guides
make sure it addresses an emotional needs
need to know their needs and how you solve them, images reinforce that messaging
How do I find free images
First up is Google image search, easy to see these
flickr is actually really good as well
another great source is wikimeida - lot of public domain that require no attributoin
as well as paper trail on how it was used in the past
unsplash has over 500,000 shared images you can freely use for a variety of reasons
lots of options these days
Use trusted sources because they will have terms that explain  licensing in one page
google does a good job of this, but has disclaimer, not 100% but it helps show your good faith efforts which protects you somewhat
Watch out for other people reuploading an image they don't own undr creative commons license
try reverse image search to see obvious violations
Make sure you are regularly reviewing your use and the terms
sometimes they change but more importantly sometimes you change
some licenses are non-profit specific for example
some specific verticals have certain rules
Licensing for images are NOT transferable
make sure you are not buying on their behalf
if they don't use it then 
tips for non-photographers to tke their own photos
Assessment.  Know what you need
want to be super organized
orientation, resolution, number needed, budget, etc
blogpost have to have an attractive image that has something to do with content
matching images
sometimes easier to just take own pics
Lighting is super important
daytime if you can
know your subject!
