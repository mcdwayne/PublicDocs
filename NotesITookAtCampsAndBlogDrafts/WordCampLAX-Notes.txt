[Discovering The WordPress REST API]()
[Josh Pollock](https://twitter.com/Josh412)


Route discovery Rest API
Post users, comments, taxoonomies, etc...

Philisophically a problem, can't just teach "do this and then this" becuase each site is different
The REST API tells us that we can do with it
Don't need to memorize these routes
learn how to process it and understand it, don't memorize code only

/wp-json (like an index of all apis)
/wp-jason/<namespace>
_links section of response"

tools for exploring APIs
Postman, ARC REST API -chrome extension
ARC
PAW - desktop app
JSONView - pretty printer for JSON
/wp-json - lear some things about the site

every route where it is
what is available

underscored linked
tells you where the link is documents

route schema
what can it do

Point is: it tells you what it is doing as a human readable description

post endpoint parameters, it will tell you all options

discoverablility FTW Every WP site is discoverable!

_links tells you where things are

Can the RESTAPI do something?  The answer is in the _links most likely, explains the connections of the data

if the schema says you can do it, you can write more defensive code,
this is how to get started discovering for yourself

[Whatâ€™s The Difference Between Blogging and Content Marketing?](https://2017.la.wordcamp.org/session/whats-the-difference-between-blogging-and-content-marketing/)
[Kitty Lusby](https://twitter.com/Kitty_Lusby)

A blog is not content marketing
First let's define a brand
got a volunteer, some of us know, most do not
this is the same as a brand
we have to inform people what he is about
this is content marketing
what is this perosn about
why do we care?
hard to do
no one goes to your website because they want to give you money
they are tryng to make their life better
compelling reason for giving money
go look at competitors
go to google in URL "forum" keyword
forums are the last ditch effort for customers
key to brand is finding intersection who you are, what you do and why people will give you money for value
brands evolve
personality evolves
it helps if you are a sociopath (half joking, need to pick up on other's personality)
Speak their language - speak on their level
Remember a human is going to read it, write intelligently
Write in slang is fine, but know what it means and your audience
http://buzzsumo.com/ is not a free tool, but very awesome tool
tells her how to better market yourself
content marketing tells you how to reach these audiences
wit is good for twitter
pintrest, can read the image even with no words at all, just tells what is in it
rank better on different platforms
know how to change your content to meet the medium
pay attention to your metrics and analytics
don't just get caught up in what the latest trends are
video for example, is labor intensive, is it for you??
if just have FB, Twitter, and website and it works, fine!  
stay where you are competent and grow gradually
be careful with brand drift
drift is great if it is evolution!  But i you are getting off topic, that is bad

[So Easy Even A Kid Can Do It: Using WordPress as a Platform for Portfolios](https://2017.la.wordcamp.org/session/so-easy-even-a-kid-can-do-it-using-wordpress-as-a-platform-for-portfolios/)
[Jansen Henschel](https://twitter.com/jansen_henschel)

Themes explained!  

Portfolios are really designed to convince someone of something
you don't need to do a lot to impress people, just impress yourself.
A portfolio makes it more real and expresses your ability more
Also a proof of work
people have short attention spans
three peices of content, that is enough to convince someone of something
Don't bury your bst work, put it front and center
people are not going to spend a lot of time on your site
"People get bored easily. so don't expect a lot out of them."
faster sites are better
Put your best work forward, don't bury
preview pics for vids reflect the interesting part - not the first frame
portfolios are convincing someone to do something
Don't distract from yourself
no ads, they are not about you
