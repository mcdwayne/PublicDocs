- Quality content is core to everything!!!

Keyword stuffing does not work anymore, keywords still matter still, old ways don't work

If you are not using the word you want to be found for in your copy you are never going to eb found for it.  

Hummingbird was Googles sentence based and voice searches
if can do that with your queries, it can totaly do that with content

Quality content important for you SEO Because- 
But it was important way before the web arrived
1) People understand your message.  
2) Lower bounce rate
3) More trust - great content with no typos and good grammer will be better to read
4) More attention on social media - better quality is easier to share

So how do I write quality content?

Research at Yoast - they hired a linguist

Writing clear paragraphs
One idea
One core sentence
not too long - 5 or 6 sentances
never randomly add whitespace within paragraphs

Use clear headings
People will scan for headings first

Short sentences, simple words
- no linger than 20 words per sentance
use simple words

Nice to read text (this is hard)

Avoid passive voice
Subject of sentance is not in the sentance

Mix it up

Yoast 3.3 = readability analysis to the plugin

If you say SEO bad no one really cares, not personal 
If you say 'Content is bad' and people get mad, is too personal 
now says 'content needs improvement'

plugin does it all in browser - not a server approach
