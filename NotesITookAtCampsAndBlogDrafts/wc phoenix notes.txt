[Poetry is the One Simple Hack](https://2017.phoenix.wordcamp.org/session/poetry-is-the-one-simple-hack/)
[Shawn Pfunder](https://twitter.com/pfunder)

Poetry has a bad rep
but there is a 
Poetry will make you better at everything
DoDaddy basically sells pens
tools get easier and easier to use
Actual creation of ideas is one solved with poetry
traditionally the person with the most funds/loudest wins the conversations
Novel
Useful
Art
iFart was novel, but not useful
Puddles pity party is art and novel example
needs all three
how to pull this off?
can't get there with just meditation
poetry is like taking a brain expanding drug
Emily Dickenson poem
Neuroscience loves poems
you are your experiences and poetry rewires your brain for the better
They found 3 things
1teach you look for connections - INstpiration
2Patience, let the ideas come to you, rest with it
3Excitement - what is truly making you happy, not the paycheck
3 colums of list of words 
brain interprests all the combos, no wrong way to do it
Billy Colins poems - litany
Seeing new connections
stealing and reworking is also OK for poems
view source 
if you come to poetry to meditate and think you will improve
and let ideas come to you
you can't force an idea out, you let them come to you
They the line breaks?
Anticipation - this is the goosebump bits
Couple examples of our brains making connections, - time after time
screw up a lot - never show up knowing the answer to poetry
learn to jettison 
intentional fallacy - you can not know what the author was intending you to experience
be quiet - be aware of what is going on around you
carry a notebook - write down these connections

[Love the Functionality, Hate the Speed, Now What?](https://2017.phoenix.wordcamp.org/session/love-the-functionality-hate-the-speed-now-what/)
[Joshua Eichorn](https://twitter.com/jeichorn)

Simple at first
small site, OK performance
add functionality and now performance sucks
now what?
full page caching>?
great except low cache hit rates, traffic from bits, logged in requests, full cache purge
it is  nice, but does nt really solve the problem overall
over 2 seconds for load times you are lost
more machine at it? 
nope, bots will take that capacity quickly
now what?  
find out why we are slow
Slow is normally IO
Slow DB query
slow HTTP request
it sometimes doing tons of fast things (show 1000 small posts at once for insceance)
its less commonly doing something slow in the php
Work?
Revert changes one at a time, but that loses functionality
1. APM, likeNew Relic (great but expensive)
2. Query Monitor, etc
3. p3 profiler
4. PHP profiles, XDebug
Tools help pinpoint slow lines of code
can actually sart to solve underlying issues now
query monitor looks for a lot of things, not just the top query
digging in found the slow..
stack trace, can ignore a lot of it
know it is not core WP, since we know t was fast before we added anything
Now what? 
Could turn off the plugin, but lose the plugin
also what if it is an API call?
Let's fix it 
if not your code fork it
plugins hosted on github makes it simple
at a minimum rename the folder, update comments
goal is to get your fixes upstream
everyone in the community wants performance help, but rename it locally if you are making these changes
running patched plugins without renaming is a good way to have auto updates ruin your day
but how do we actually fix this?
cache the API call
use a work flow - process outside the normal loads
caching using transients
transients are the generic WP caching API
store data in object cache if available 
Example - render method
caching with long TTL 
is caching enough
	maybe not if not high enough cache hit rate
	long tail content
	bits crawling 
	that is the API gets slower?
Really only option is either stop making the call or move it out of flow
If you have the data, display it
if you don't queue a reequest to load it, make API request outside normal flow
WPMinions (from 10UP) (requires another server/service outside your appserver)
WP Background Processing (not as high capacity but less dependencies)
Let's build a basic queue
store jobs in an option
process them using wp-cron
limitatoins
	keeo the max queueu size small
	low max processing rate (wp-cron is serial, not parallel, limited around timeouts as well)
	will be prone to race conditions
Setup the cron for 5 minute intervals
have to be able to handle rendering to handle no value (maybe swap in default data)
	this is a trade off, sometimes nothing to show
Return a cache value or queue
	instead of a normal API call, invoke the queue or cache
Make the API calls in the Cron - this is the bottleneck now
never going to get insane capacity from this simple work queue
limited worker on a fixed time cycle
remove the tasks from the queue
	clear out the in memory cache
at its heart, this is the same content as a site with far less functionality
queue results should improve all the page loads
Problem solved?  probably
the queue neeeds to keep up
high rate sites will need something more robust
the fixes:
	added a full page cache
	patched the plugin
		caching aroround API calls
		moving API calls to a work queue

KEYNOTE: 
[In Praise of the Side Project: How to Learn New Skills, Make Money, and Have a Little Fun]()
[Rachel Cherry](https://twitter.com/bamadesigner)

side projects are not side hustles
maybe you make money
maybe you contribute to a community
planning WC is def a side project
giving back to others
podcasts
help with someone else's side project
Side projects can be whatever you want tthem to be
ust be motivated though
only so much free time
fill n gaps that you see missing
want to donate time? 
are you going to burn yourself out?  Side projects can give your mind a break
Her side projects
hiroy.club
wpcampus
tips and tricks
	have a goal
	write everything down
	forulate a plan, start small
	break everything into small tasks
	ask for help (when you need it)
	Perfection is the enemy
	be selfish
	publish your work or a recap
Challenge yourself
at least an hour a week to give yourself a chance to focus on something else

[The WordPress REST API: Powering Every Platform](https://2017.phoenix.wordcamp.org/session/the-wordpress-rest-api-powering-every-platform/)
[Cory Crowley](https://twitter.com/corycrowley)
[John Gough](https://twitter.com/john_gough)

managing content is like herding cats
Siloed access
single source of truth
MVC explained
Iron Man
Tony is the Model
the suit is the view, what we physically see
Jarvis is the controller
People using APi for a lot of stuff
building sites with JS
Mobile app dev with WP
replacing AJAX
publishing content everywhere
Use case: events
Role play developer at a university and ain implementer
what they need to show (title, duration, etc) long list
adding new events to websites
not just a static PDF
Here is mock up, do it by tomorrow
no sleep, overworked
reasonable request with a bad timeline
need basic event post type
but also need to shw by location and bt category
register a taxonomy
need an application
can use ACF PRO 
no sleep lost
now they want to have new events in a kiosk
Can do this with HTML5 veu.js php
pull the content from a single source of truth
siloed access, not content
ACF to REST-API
you can do this manually, but this is an easier path, simple
Next up, build an app! orientation, showing off events by category and location
Again getting the events from system of truth
vue.js looks very similar to kiosk, just pulling from multiple locations
Our imagination is the only limit to what can be done with WP

[Myths and Facts About Securing Your Site](https://2017.phoenix.wordcamp.org/session/myths-and-facts-about-securing-your-site/)
[Aaron D. Campbell](https://twitter.com/aaroncampbell)

Security is not hard or scary
it does not have to be
1 Updates improve security = FACT
Update all the things!
2 No one will attack me = MYTH
vast majority of attacks are scripted attacks
you will be attacked, just know that doing in
Staying up to date helps, but these are mostly automated scripts and we can stay one step ahead by studying them
3 Locking down files = MYTH
leaving a back door - files won't be able to write to them, 
this focuses on the wrong part
you want to keep people out of your house, not just specific rooms
problem comes up is updating
one of their best tools is force updating security patches
4 avoid using admin user name = myth
keep username private and secret is not real because your username is ultimately discoverable
you cna log in with yuor email, which is pretty easy to get
you should focus on better passwords and maybe 2 factor auth
5 Changing DB tables prefixes = MYTH
easily discoverable but no added 'security through obscurity'
when yuo yhink you are doing something to secure your site but it does nto do much, it lulls you innot a false sense of security
6 Move/Hide admin = MYTH
does not help to protect from hackers
no front door, people still know there is still a door you use
This actuallt causes more issues than it solves
7 SSL improves securty = FACT!  
important for each and every site, no reason should not go with SSL
everything between your user computer and the server and all things between 
make sure allt traffic is encrypted
if a weak point, then makes sure no one can see what is being passed
8 Passwords are important = FACT
obvious one, lets talk instead about the way to make good passwords and what makes the good
	Long passwords are better = fact!
		password strength are mesured in entropy = takes longer to break
	Substitutions = MYTH
		every modern cracker knows the patterns and only adds a small additoinal ammount of effort to break
	Passphrases, taking a memorable moment and making a passphrase from it = PLAUSIBLE
		27 characters but only 5 words, password crack scripts have gotten more advanced
		can pull in keywords from social media to build a specific dictionary to use for the attack
		better than just a simple one word passphrase but not the best method
	use a password manager makes it best = FACT!  
		these manages like Lastpass (which I use) make long unique, random passwords and manage them for you
