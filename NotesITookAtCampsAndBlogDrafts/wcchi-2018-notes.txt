[Digital Therapy](https://2018.chicago.wordcamp.org/session/digital-therapy-beyond-project-management-managing-client-emotions/)
[Ellie Saldana](https://2018.chicago.wordcamp.org/speakers/#wcorg-speaker-ellie-saldana)

Story about client who was afraid of getting fired from her role because spikes/lulls in traffic
she helped her realize that was seasonal and normal
saves her a lot of issues
Bringin emotional intelligence into the digitial experience
Why? Clients feel unheard. Looking for validatoin
Clients don't feel ownership over the digital shrere of their business
how:
Pick up the phone and smile
be transparent, even if you are at fault
dig deeper into understanding client frustrations
help clients understand the process
ou don't always have to say yes
a strong client relationship makes it easier
Don't just day no, NO but..., NO because...
Give clients a win when you can
not all clients are created equal
remember what worked last time might not work this time
your last experiences with them does not mean next one will be the same
Few different kinds of clients
Lone Decision Makers
client is empowered to make decisojs on their own
Answers To A Higher Authority
have to report up a chain
accountable to others
Oftentimes not the person qualified to run a site
need to help them look competent to their management
THE COMMITTEE
Hardest one to her
multiple contacts all with different points of view
need help coming to consensus
lot of active listening needed
client needs to do homework to find out that is actually important to the org
they need a unified vision to get the help they need
Conclusion:
Enge the cleint
Listen actively
Preblem solve collectively

What is Data Science
Short answer: Mine data to Make better business decisoins
Very indemand
Full stack $88K
Data Science colser to $118K

Math is Mental Abouse to Humans (not really)
math is not bad
just enough to make the machine do the math
Additional skills
JS, Pythin, SQL, C++, C, Scala - for algebric equasions and covariance and contravariance
R - oss stats software and language, SAS, Julia
What do we do with it all?
Case studies
Scenario 1: try and predict sales based on time od fay and weather patterns in common industries
Scenario 2 - (Missed it)
You need to do anthing that requires data and math operations. The programming end of things you need to be able to make desicions

[WooCommerce Success](https://2018.chicago.wordcamp.org/session/woocommerce-success/)
[Patrick Elward](https://twitter.com/chiwebmgmt)

Someone has o take ownership
Many of the tasks you hav with other ecommerce is same with Woo
but Woo is arguably easier
Store owners
Who has an online store now
financial commitment sot oeprsations
Review, review, review
How much budger?  10-15% of annual sales is realistic expendeture for eccomerce operations (not ads, just logistics and such)
Shopping cart vs Woo
Key e-commerce tasks to be discssed before starting
tax levels, ownership.....
Product Management Success
What thy have to sell, right now!
how to display these on the site
many 'Product Import' plugins available
how to organize by atribute
setup tags and keywords for sorting
Go through product with the customer and weigh everything
sizes and weights are super expensive if we get it wrong
attribute in Woo lets you assign this easily
Photos must be realistic
it is how the client will judge the product they receive
Reviews matter
they MUST be monitored though
Inventory management is a challenge as well
How to handle 'out of stock'
hide product or display Out od Stock
who recieves 'low inventory trigger' and what is that threshold
Drop shipping and custom labels, look into SaaS solutions for that
"Does it save my warehouse money or can we do it cheaper ourselves?" 
Shipping management
Fedex, etc...
3 main ways to get shipping costs
per total weiht (most common)
Make sure you are only shipping places you want to ship
or charge more
Prelaunch comments
ALWAYS check on mobile devile
ongoing support and maintenance
Common mistakes
budget not realistic

[Erasing the Stigma: Mental Health and Tech](https://2018.chicago.wordcamp.org/session/erasing-the-stigma-mental-health-and-tech/)
[JD Flynn](https://twitter.com/JDDoesDev)

Raw Notes:
Has mental illness, 
Most costly health concern right now
lot of stigma
Why should this be important? 
Suffering in silence and denial 
afraid of admitted it it would make it more real
Thought was perfect health until doctor said otherwise
people
Major depression - every day for at least 2 weeks
very wide range of incarnation
Anxiety disorder - fear of daily activities
PTSD - failure to recover after an experience 
a phycologiest explained it
RAM vs hard disk
short term and laong term memory
RAM is fast and HardDisk is slow
PTSD something stuck in RAM and trigger makes them relive the trauma
I accepted somethign was wrong - THE HARDEST PART
then got treatment
your first therapist will not likely be your last
must find one that works with you and communicates with your style
got involved in community (band, OSS, etc)
got to be comfortable that not everyone is OK talking about this
Before treatment, thought only crazy people saught help
felt like would mess up everythign he touched
was easy to get into a downward spiral
paranoid, afraid of social situations, isolated was self imposed
Misunderstood, thought he as angry when he was just anxious
in a wedding standing up, trying not to screw it up
people thoguht he was being mean
How has treatment affected him?
the symptoms have not completely vanished but gotten better
lizard brain is still there
lot more comfortable in social situations
I'm not/We're not alone
Why Tech and mental illness?
tech specifically affected 
increased IQ linked to more mental issues (studies suggest)
You would never tell someone in a wheelchair to 'get over it'
but we socially do this to mental issues all the time
need to be stronger than fear!
Do you think an employer would have negative consequences after talking wiht them about your mental health, most people that yes
as of 2015 17.9% of all US Adults had some form of mental issues
We are afraid to talk about mental health
it is a stigma
afraid honesty has negative consequences
Afraid of getting sent to HR
Why should a workplace care?  
Impact on performance, job insecurity
HR does not want to hear about it
We should fight ignroance with information and knowledge
Get the OSMI handbook
In OSS, 50% of survey respondents said they had some form of mental illness
we are people together
not 1s and 0s
we are people
we are not damaged, we are sick
1-800-therapist
phycology today has a search
look for someone who can help, not just tossing meds out

[Meta and Schema: Defining the Content about your Content](https://2018.chicago.wordcamp.org/session/meta-and-schema-defining-the-content-about-your-content/)
[Jim Birch](https://twitter.com/thejimbirch)

How do we look to others? 
How does content look to others?
what you do for google is good for all the other services
TL/R Specs and validators
w3c HTML 5.2 specs
WATWG Meta Extensions
Open Graph
Twitter cards
schema.org

Meta, from the greek, prefix, concept 
like card catalogues
full time gig back in the early days of libraries
computerize
Dynix, early but popular
Enter the W3C defining 5.2 spec
4.2 docs about Document Metadata
6 things
- head element
- title only one
- base tag, element to set the base for something
- link, link to other resources 
- style - embed information in the doc for styling
- meta - for everything not the previous 5
all name value pairs, only in the head of the doc
name=> value(content)
There are defined metatags in the spec
author, application-name, description, etc
pragma directives language construct that specifies copiler and other technical information
Other Metadata names
WHATWG
list all that have been applied for and their extentions
You can make your own metadata you define on your own
no one would know it was there but you, but you can do some stuff like priprity of search engine
Unicorn from W3C
see how good of a coder you are? 
pass/fail for 
https://validator.w3.org/unicorn/
Validation
Google meta tag validator for things it understands
title, googlebot, refresh
that is it for google, one document, that is all
Open Graph Protocol
Let's webpage to become object
required fields
title, type, image, url
Types:
 music, video, book, etc
FB has a debugger - important to use for FB to re-scrape content
pinterest validator
LinkedIn - using random variable at the end of url to force them to refresh
(?hfhfsh)
twitter card
rich photos and such
summary
summary large image
player card
app card
they also have a validator
How to implement in WP?
Yeast SEO plugin
add meta and fills in some things for you
can but in Open Graph tags
same with twitter cards
Theme itself can use logic to use image via php code
Schema
Started by google, Open source
way to put structured data on sites, in email messages and beyond!
schema.org
goes on for days
drill down into most of them
Most popular are creative works
can implement a few different ways
inline was first and popular
JSON-LD
What does Google care about?
Google Search Gallery Page
https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery
How? Yoast of course
Schema PLugin
JDFlynn mae a tool to generate the needed JSON
again, theme can use logic to suss this out
Test and Verify
Google to test

[Plugins vs Themes. Functionality vs Format.](https://2018.chicago.wordcamp.org/session/plugins-vs-themes-functionality-vs-format/)
[Austin Adamson](https://twitter.com/austin_be_nerdy)

Inherited an old site
When activated new theme
all office staff and content just vanished
oh no
put so much functionality in themes
realized he had been doing same thing
plugins and themes do different things for a reason
what is supposed to do what?
building a house
start with a frame and a foundation
the utilities (water, lights)
lastly we paint
we live there for a while
repaint the walls
didn't have to call the electrician or bulldose the whole thing
but we di this with websites all the time
WP core is frame of the house, 
plugins are utilities
and theme is the paint
repainting is a new theme
should be just that easy
what is even core?
file structure from WP.org
functionality should not be in themes
example
AgentPress Pro theme, $99
when you get theme, must download a free plugin that gives functionality
registering custom post types, should be in plugin, in agent plus plugin
metaboxes, 
gravity forms, output CSS yes/no
turn it off, don't overwrite gravity forms style
wpmeetup plugin
forces big red button
can't turn it off, hard to override
theme controls presentation of content
plugin controls functionality
