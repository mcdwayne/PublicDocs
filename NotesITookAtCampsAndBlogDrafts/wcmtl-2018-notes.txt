[Bridging the Gap between Designers & Developers](https://2018.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/bridging-the-gap-between-designers-developers/)
[Mehgan Dove](https://twitter.com/mdovedesign)


Designers, 
learn some development
if you are handing over things and not care how it is implemented
and don't know what is hard or complex and don't care
you are going to hae a bad time
Devs, 
have some respect for your designeers work and skill
Handover in layers
Design s not arbitrary
show some respect
layouts are hierarchical in so many ways
Devs should not have ot guess or recreate things in photoshop
communicate!
provide layers!
use guidelines and agree

[How to Format Your Text to Help Your Readers](https://2018.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/how-to-format-your-text-to-help-your-readers/)
[FRANCESCA MARANO](https://twitter.com/FrancescaMarano)

History lessons
March 12, 1989 Sir Tim
makes proposal for HTML
1993 publishes stadards
10/1/1997
Jakob Nielsen "How Users Read on the Web"
Summary: they don't
they scan picking out individual words and sentences
Wall of text loses everyone
HTML is not a programming language is markup
structure of a page
semantically - elements themselves describe the content
Know the basic tags
p
blockquote
ol
ul
li
H1 - H6 and accessibility
Don't use H1 on the page or post, that is reserved for the page title
important for SEO and Ally
having H4 without an H2 is actually really bad
Help all readers
think older readers
Formatting in wordpress
Gutenberg is coming
1/2 the room never heard it was coming
Tour of the editor and Admin
Bold and Italics
not for pretty
for emphasis
Alignment is important
stick with left alignment unless Hebrew or other langguage with RtL

[A Buddhist Guide to WordPress Development](https://2018.montreal.wordcamp.org/session/a-buddhist-guide-to-wordpress-development/)
[JER CLARKE](https://twitter.com/jerclarke)

Buddism and Jer
Pn Pali and theravada
very diverse religion, lots of sects
school of the elders, sri lanka, thailand
root of secular ones
Vipassana
sources for secular buddhism
Contracted with Mahayana, greater vehicle, a diverse branch in china and Japan
FYI: Words here ar in Pali not sanskrit
Religion or Philosophy
both metaphysical and pragmatic
most teachings apply directly to material life
its an ancient science, got some things right
Ancient indian comology is weird and a bit crazy, metephircally can teach a lot though
Buhhism is a series of very useful lists
Quick mediatation, anapanasati breathing meditation
breath in
breath out
just be 
5 minutes exercise
Impermanane
lacking
essential
anicca impermanence
whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation
everything changes and we are all going to die
everything we have is borrowed, death or WP updates will take it all away
Dukkha
Stress
often translated as suffering and pain and dissatisfaction
nothing lives up to our hopes, so everything brings disappointment and stress
unpleasant things are dukkha because we can't avoid them
pleasant thinggs are dukkha because we can't hold onto them
Anatta
Lack of essential self
Three features of every CMS, PLugin and Theme
Impermanent: Won't last forever
Unsatisfying: Guaranteed to disappoint
essense-free: Just a bunch of code
accept these things and let them go!
Cause of stress is clinging to our expectations
when we try to control the world, we suffer pointlessly
the 'second arrow' is the one we shoot ourselves
cycle of clinging and disappointment
when we imaging WP won't challenge us that is makes us crazy
End of stress is freedom from clinging
if we accept things we are free from dissapointment 
Wisdom, Virtue, Mindfulness
8fold path
Kamma truth cause and effect
really meands actions
kammic fruition are effects of your karma
intention is key, as long as we know our intentions are truely good we can live with peace of mind
Samsara WO
Rebirth WP
We are reborn when we return to old themes, plugins and code
we inherit the decisions of our past selves, good or bad
learn from challenges you've passed on to yourself
wee clearly how your current decisions will determine your future
Sati
mindfullness
check the logs
being aware of yourself and body and mind in each step
Samadhi
mediation
Samadhi means concentration as well as meditation
set aside time jsut fro this training
meditate on wholesome states to develop altered states
like any skill, regular focused practice is how we get better
Metta
lovingkindness
metta - kindness
Panna wisdom
all expereinces created in our mind
accept things as they are, let go of what is painful
clear concience and open heart
be mindful
mediate as much as you can and it all gets easier

fell confident when troubleshooting
Backup and Staging 
Backups - important, fall back point
Google is your guide

sometimes WP codex
sometimes stackoverflow

scenario 1 pending payment orders with Stripe

test by doing the action yourself
reading a bit of the docs revealed the expected behaviors had changed
simple as a setting was blocking their issues
