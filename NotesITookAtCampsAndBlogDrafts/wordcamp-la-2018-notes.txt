WordCamp LA 2018: A flawless Jenga game and a mariachi band 

Once more I returned to [La La Land](http://got.net/~landauer/lists/CityOf.html), a city I have mixed feelings about.  There is lot of really cool stuff there.  Some of the [finest restaurants](https://la.eater.com/2017/12/29/16831500/michelin-stars-los-angeles-2017-hypothetical) and most [imaginative bars](https://www.thrillist.com/drink/los-angeles/43-la-bars-you-need-to-drink-in-before-you-die-los-angeles-drinking-bucket-list) on earth.  They also have a [rich cultural history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Los_Angeles) and just the loveliest [backdrop of mountains and ocean landscapes](http://www.welikela.com/sick-views-los-angeles-easy-access/) maybe anywhere in these united states.  Unfortunately this is all covered in a layer of smog and the most infuriating traffic in North America, which makes the people, well, let's leave it as 'affected by the bad parts'.   These are the main reasons I moved away all those years ago.  But I was very glad to be back for a brief stay because seeing my WordPress friends would make it all worth it as I got to go to [WordCamp Los Angeles 2018](https://2018.la.wordcamp.org/)

## Food and Fun

### Speaker Dinner

After spending almost as much time in a Lyft to get from my hotel to the restaurant as I did on the plane from [SFO](https://twitter.com/flySFO) to [Burbank](https://twitter.com/fly_BUR), I finally arrived at [Blue Cow Kitchen and Bar](https://bluecowkitchen.com/menu.html). It was awesome to be greeted by so many friendly familiar and soon to be familiar faces. If you know me at all you know I love hugs, so having so many people coming up and just giving them out freely is a happy time.  There were plenty of appetizers and drink tickets on hand as well. Afterward some of us wanted to get our pinball and [Street Fighter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhixpUmIsKg) at [EightyTwo](http://eightytwo.la) a "A 21+ classic arcade and bar located in the Arts District of Downtown Los Angeles".  It was a wonderful first night.

### Saturday.  There is a Starbucks on the ground floor of the [Cal State LA](http://www.calstatela.edu/) Student Union but we got tolerable coffee from catering services instead.  Snacks were not rolled out until the afternoon, so we were all ravenous when they wheeled out their lunch options.  Going to say it loud and proud, this organizing team made sure dietary restrictions were honored and respected and still gave me awesome schwag.  I know some camps prioritize the latter at all costs, but it is great when a balance for accessibility is achieved.  Good work!

### WPVegan

I know I am going to get to a point with this community effort where it is going to be so hum-drum that people got together to experience finely crafted plant based foods that it will not merit a mention.  But for now, I am celebrating every victory and omnivore who says "wow, I had I had no idea you could do that veggies" after finishing an amazing meal.  In the LA area, Pasadena specifically, there is a magical place called [My Vegan](https://www.yelp.com/biz/my-vegan-pasadena) that makes inexpensive and mond boggling good Thai and American foods that we could gather at for a fine meal before the after party.  Plant power!

### After Party

We once again returned to the Blue Cow and I got treated really well by the staff.  It is the little things that matter in customer service and the speed and skill of their mixologists combined with those little things made sure we had a good time.  We also had face painting, giant Connect Four and [giant Jenga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r8XQSbiYzk).  I partnered with _the_ video game and board game superstar legend [Devin from BlueHost](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devinsears/) and we did not lose, instead hitting a draw as we more than doubled the size of the Jenga tower.  It was something a lot of people never saw before and made quite the spectacle.

https://twitter.com/WordCampLAX/status/1043707456130568192


The location proved hard to find for Lyft, so we made our way on foot afterward to [The Exchange](https://freehandhotels.com/los-angeles/the-exchange/) where we had even fancier things and got to know one another better.  This late night community building does have a cost and I knew the late night meant a tired morning, but honestly, I would not trade those conversations for anything.  Not just this time, but every time.  You are welcome to join us.  

### Sunday

More fo the same, but we got the leftover snacks, mostly granola and snack bars and pretzels, first thing in the morning, so breakfast was sweet.  It also meant we were not as ravenous when they rolled out a clone of the previous day's lunch menu.  Consistant and satisfying, I do want to applaud their catering team.

Some of us went back to My Vegan again before heading out

## Sessions


### My session

[Let’s learn Git. No more excuses.](https://2018.la.wordcamp.org/session/lets-learn-git-no-more-excuses/)

This went well.  I have given this enough times now that I am starting to see and understand patterns in questions and reactions from the audience.  I am giving this a few more times this year and now I want to rewrite it with these fresh learnings making it more focus on the concept and strip out a lot fo the code examples.  I'd love feedback on this if you have seen the talk or want to go through [my slides for my Git talk](https://www.mcdwayne.com/lets-learn-git-no-more-excuses/).  Feedback welcome! Thanks to all how came out.

[7 Little Tricks In Your WordPress Settings You Might Be Missing](https://2018.la.wordcamp.org/session/7-little-tricks-in-your-wordpress-settings-you-might-be-missing/)
[Gee Nonterah](https://twitter.com/geenonterah)

We were all beginners at one point.  And if you were like me you mashed every button there was to see what it did and to better understand the menu options.  Some people are not like this and are actually scared of mashing buttons on things for fear of breaking something.  Very fortunate for all of us there are wonderful folks like Gee who patiently explain these basics.  I snuck in because, belive it or not, I have never actually methodically ever thought about the WP Admin screen settings and how new people would interpret them.  While the session was great, I think the real value was the Q&A section, which gave newcomers the chance to ask any question around this area of interest and we all learned together.

[The Dating Game: Understanding Price Anchoring](https://2018.la.wordcamp.org/session/the-dating-game-understanding-price-anchoring/)
[Nathan Allotey](https://twitter.com/nathanallotey)

THe first talk I ever gave at any camp was about [pricing](https://www.slideshare.net/DwayneMcDaniel/pricing-strategy-and-planning-dcco), so this topic holds a bit of a special place in my heart.  I met Nathan the night before at the Speaker Dinner and based on how awesome he seemed I had to go see how he approached this topic.  Well friends, this was one of the most entertaining and well researched talks I can recall recently.  This is going to be a 'most watched' talk after it gets to WordPress.tv.  For a tast of one of the many things that made this talk awesome: He once build a landing page with value anchoring options to get a date.  Real story.  Real results.  

Raw Notes:
Learned as a freelancer
Envato job got access to all tutorials and he learned a lot quickly
got MBA at University of Texas
now he shares what he knows
The Dating Game, been around for a while
host and contestant on one side
Is the show about dating?  Mystery? Couples?  What is it about?
Shares his client on-boarding process
email - email them back - background research - in person meeting is possible or remote - research - proposal
client would negotiate
client would accept and the  scope creep
client would decline
he was spending too much time with the client in the process and not closing
Came across Cognitive Bias
individuals create their 
Your brains take shortcuts to proces complex decisions
MIT students survey Web only $59 or web and print for $125
68% 32% 
web only print only 125 both 125
15% 0% 84%
price anchoring
common cog bias, rely on the first piece of information
only gauge people have for pricing is what they paid in the past
expensive compared to what?
I see price anchoring
anchoring appears in romantic comedies
all these movies introduce choice and perception
Hitch
a date doctor/consultant
whole movie was about positioning
spoiler alert, it is so old it comes on TNT
Hitch meets a lady and his moves don't work
he had been hurt
got serious once choice was introduced
his character was forced to act
introducing choice to your pricing, helps clients make a decision in your favor
The Steve Jobs Way
keynote
ipad
$999 dropped to $499 on the day it was introduced
gave a higher price to anchor and then lowered the price 
Did that meeting even happen?
Inception 
a dream in a dream in a dream
put ideas in people's minds
price inception, is that a thing?
Carola, Camry, Lexus
A lot of websites that show 3 prices  
contact us = a lot of zeros
spotify
free or premium
[pages.xyz/type/pricing](https://www.pages.xyz/type/pricing)
does it really work?
Nathan Logic: "If this principle works then it should work if I try it on something obscure"
back to the dating game
LA trip
true story
built a landing page for 
it would be great to see and hang out with Rihanna
we can go to ryan goslings wedding
or get something to eat
sunday go to church
FAQ
position questions so your answer is yes in reply
and it worked
Price anchoring works and we see it all the time
how can we apply it to our business?
basic, plus and advanced level if you are offering service
basic solves the core problem
pricing to make some $
1x || 1.5x to 2.5x || 3x to 5x
what to make advanced?
think about what your clients request you don't offer but end up doing anyway
wp101.com
offering WP tutorials for every version
you can white label it
anchoring the prices
month to month or annual
grammarly.com
anchoring services, backups, etc
if you are interfacing with clients, anchor those services
original design files
usibilityhub.com
preference testing
difference between customer service and customer assumption
Always user price anchoring when giving prie
use services which focus on increased value
make sure it is profitable to do so
define project scope in your contract based on the selected

[How to start testing an existing WordPress plugin with PHPUnit](https://2018.la.wordcamp.org/session/how-to-start-testing-an-existing-wordpress-plugin-with-phpunit/)
[BEHZOD SAIDOV](https://twitter.com/behzod)


why?
make sure it works
you will have a safety net
refactoring bcomes easy
when bugs show up, tests can be written to ensure that these issues are exposed
faster debugging and prevent future errors
can provide documentation for code as well
whaat do you need to start testing
UNIX based OS, hard with windows, don't even try
PHP
MySQL
PHPUnit testing lib
WP test suite
wp-cli (optional)
multiple ways to set this up
can take time to set this up
Maybe use VVV
scaffolding your test suite
wp-cli lets you do this qucikly and in best way
demo inside vvv
what does it add
phpunit.xml.dist
bin/install-wp-tests.sh
tests/bootstrap.php
tests/test-sample.php
.phpcs.xml.dist - code sniffer rules
.travis.yml
phpunit.xml.dist - `testsuites` is key to it all
searches for files that start with `test-` and ends with `.php`
bootstrap.php
search the WP test suite and runs tha bash script
wo_test_dir and wo_core_dir
shows location of tests and core
instll-wp-tests.sh
downloas the required WP version, installs test suite
no need to run in vvv
important to do this on travis pipeline or the like
what is a test?
thest are pulic methods that prefix with test
alternatively, you can use the @test anon
assertions are methods 
used to assert an actual value matches an expected value
PHPUnit comes with a lot of assertion methods, some exmaples assertFals, AssertEquals, AssertNull
`$this->assertEquals(4, $calculator->(2, 2))`
integration for WP
WP methods
integration tests
write to a file
open a DB connection
do something over a network
DEMO, let's write some tests for our plugin
factories let you generate things inside your code
it is hard to start
you need to motivate yourself
it can seem pointless at first
in the long term, you will see obviious benefits
see how catching mistakes and problems

[Close Your Eyes: Helping See Value in Accessibility](https://2018.la.wordcamp.org/session/close-your-eyes-helping-see-value-in-accessibility/)
[JOE A SIMPSON JR](https://twitter.com/joesimpsonjr)


literally cose your eyes
he moved around
lot of stats we hear about disability
today we are talking about it from a designer standpoint
are we designing for 1/5 less of our potential audience
ignoring 20% of users
eants to turn us into advocates
There are no constraints ont h human mind. No walls atoung th human spirit, no barrirts to our progress except the ones we accept
I always use the carpool lane as a solo driver
worth the risk
this is what we do for our designs a lot when not thinking a11y
maybe compliance lawsuites for ADA
eHarmony, Disney, US Dept of Education
this is the scared straight section
Web COntent A11y guidelines
WCAG 1999
updated to 2.0 in 2008, 2.1 2016
if you take federal funds, need to meet Section 508
almost the same as WCAG now
"We really like the brand colors we used.  They are much more lively than darker ones" - not compliant though
colors
simulating color blindness example
content is easier to see and hear when:
color is not used as the only way of conveying info or IDing an object
foregrowns and background color should contrast
WebAIM color contrast checker
contrast0ratio.com
"We have a very lmited audience for this site and the design caters to them"
they didn't want to make a mobile site
content
Headings, lists, tables and other structures in the content are marked-up properly
semantic content struture tells the screenreader how the page is laid out
don't use Headers out of order, created screenreader confusion
YOASTSEO is great tool for readability as well
avoid 'click here' or 'read more' or 'doanload'
these are meaningless
meaningful link text that described the content being linked to
underlying links is so simple but very important
bold for more impact
don't put too much information
img tag already says it is am image
can be empty alt text if caption already suffices and a link
colorblind graphs
all same squiggly lines
ust change shapes for each line
Themes
they present what we want to present to our clients
WP Acessible-ready" themes
an optonal stage of theme review psorcess that looks for certain things
keyboard nav
controls
skip links
forms
headings
AIOA compliant
search by feature on wp.org
only 123 A11y ready themes on wp.org

[Gutenberg Q & A Panel](https://2018.la.wordcamp.org/session/gutenberg-q-a-panel/)
[LARA SCHENCK](https://twitter.com/laras126), 
[LEO POSTOVOIT](https://twitter.com/postphotos), 
[ROY SIVAN](https://twitter.com/royboy789), 
[MATT CROMWELL](https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc)

why are you excited about Gutenberg
Lara - content with a designer in mind
Leo - the future coming together
roy - react coming into core, huge deal
what concerns you
roy - data, cool array?  Not how it is saved to the DB
will make it hard to power a ot of other things without structured data
Leo - a lot of sites I have built will break on content alone
unless we train people right, we might lose a lot mindshare
Gutenberg Ramp
Lara -  node models will take up all HD space
Likes writing JS, but how CSS works in Gutes, removed seperation of concerns
can be an ok place if standards are good, but bad practices are likely to sneak in
Question:
What about page builders?  It scares me
Leo: Gutenberg Ramp
the future is more wide open, think beyond the page builder and base use cases for WP
reach out to the pagebuilder team and ask about Gutes
Roy: difference between Gutes and page builder
Gutes is content, page builder for layouts and around content
right now they are different
Pagebuilder is on the hook to work with Gutes, not you
--distraction---
Question: Worried about content and page structure 
how will we interact with that data
Roy: Structured data, (question asker using ACF)
ACF is going to support Gutes, just released that version
has not played with it yet
data of Gutenberg - backwards compatibility is the crutch
you can force it to use structured data by hijacking the DB
Airstream use case
Leo:
Gutes is agnostic to CMS< this is a failing of WP core
Lara: display in the editor to move around and configure

[How To Give A WordPress Presentation](https://2018.la.wordcamp.org/session/how-to-give-a-wordpress-presentation/)
[JANSEN HENSCHEL]()

3 mian points
be prepared
even your neorvousness 

1. be preapared
organize your  presentation
what are the things you want stuck in their head when they leave
what sticks out to people ae the highlight
if at a loss
start with main points
take away from the presentations 3 - 5  points
criticcal that the audience knows what will talk about
there are 4 types of people
begineer
knowing how to use email to excell google docs
some have not mastered their own phones yet
on beginner day a few 
corporations and non-profits like universities
if ffor the beginner crowd
not enough knowledge to 
designer
may be not the best coders even thogough greart at design
classic design
may not be as knowledgable 
UX or UI better though maybe
intermediate person
have a website, but not much traffic going to it
what is next stage
business and marketing
plan for them they know what thtey are doing
looking for speific solutions to their problems
Advanced 
coding and marketing are pros
looking for more clients
not everyone fits into these groups perfectly. 
general idea
Last year was about beginner, design and intermeddiate wordpresser
learednd but mayby forgot
if people have take out their slides 
lot of drawing in 
also avoid having your slives be an exact copy of your presentations
slides should support of what you are talking about
or image expressing the idea
you cn't plan for everything
slides mess up with projectors
do not trust anyting WiFi
give them one forever contact
you never know when someon ewill watch 
you never know why they will watch
a forever contact info you 
don't attach it to your business
businesses come and go
give people all your information
people come to conferences fot the experience of the presentation
make your presentation seena dn heard
something funny or interesting to set your apart
people a thtere for information
Even yout nervousness
wont keep you from giving a great presneations
Don't be nervous does not work, cause you will get nervous
days leading up to the event 
mac and cheesemom waid we are all supporting you
thought it was just him mom
then someone in community said same thing and he started to belive it
I want to be dissapointed
they want to see a good presentation
you might think you will fail but that is just your nervoursness
anti mesurment measures
read it aloud
to yourself out loud
notince all the things wrong
time dress rehearsals to adjust to time slot
introduce yourself to establish a connectionand build comfidence
don't let other nised derail you
speak loudly
to be heard
do a sound check to establish 
if writing a joke into it, leave a pause
don't talk over their reactions
you might be talking too fast or being fidgetyy
pauses help people catch up
don't speed through your slides
when asked a question, repeat the question
recordings can't hear the audience as well as you can
loot at the audience 
even your nervousness won't keep you from giving a great presnetation
point 3
tell your personal story
you might think you don't have enough to say but why are you here?
why do this stuff?
the hard parts are the compelling subjects
some people don't want to admit they got stuck on something 'simple' in retrospect
but everyone goes through it
hard to code at first, ut went to forums
figured it out
hard lessons around setting bounries at beginning
WordPress or any community constantly needs new blood
often he is the only kid in the room
never think that you are alone and no one wants your knowledge
bosun section
write down all your thoughts
just write down all ideas
get everything down
write down main points, what you learned
number them 
if you have a funny or vague
if people seem confuse they stay confused
people remember stories
when people get stuck, your ideas can fly out
use or lose them but just write them
if stuck, do something you don't really like but is a chore
free your mind when the body is working
brings up new ideas
even if you can't think up something new at least you did someothng productinve
"Dealing with difficult teeamates" saple talk
1. main point
 1. supporting fact
 2. supporting fact
 3. supporting fact
2. main point
 1. supporting fact
 2. supporting fact
 3. supporting fact
3. main point
 1. supporting fact
 2. supporting fact
 3. supporting fact
what do you want people to remember
be clear about your work
understand your coworkers
don't be afraid to ask for common decencies
basic overarching story and main points
the real conclusion
