Let's stap back from Story and look at fundamental Pipeline Strategy 
Run through what each stage means.  
Discovery is ----NEXT SLIDE----Getting client to open up and tell what they want and are willing to go on a -----JOURNEY TO GET

Wait:  If we are writing down a story of a journey, we have a very handy methodology we can borrow from. StorySpine 

We can use this as a Framework. This is extremely useful for letting clients know up front that there will be some 'because of that' going on and it is a climb.  When doubts set in, as they almost always will, you can remind them of the desired end state and the reality of the journey

Also gives you some mile markers, informal or formal goals to hit as projects progress.
