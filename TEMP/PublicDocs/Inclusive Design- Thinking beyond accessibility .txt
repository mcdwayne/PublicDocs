Inclusive Design: Thinking beyond accessibility

1) No user is average
Myth of Averages
If you design for the average, you are literally designing for nobody

- Adjustable seat in jet fighters came from this - 

Create personas with limitations

For example "suffers from red-green colorblindness"
"Has a broken wrist due to a skiing accident"
"Does most work while traveling"

Map users based on behaviors
Create impact map of expected behaviors
Why -> Who -> How -> What

We believe no user is average

2) Every user deserves equal access

only 43% of internet browsing in Iceland comes from desktop machines
57% is mobile/other
Structure in a way that makes sense

Using semantic markup, bit.ly/IDXSemBBC
Use progressive design to deliver experience
prioritize that needs loaded

Google does not care what your design is, it cares how it loads and how accessbile content is

Average global internet speed 5.6 Mbps
Republic of Mali = 0.5 Mbps
South Korea = 26.7 Mbps

Artificially limiting ourselves
- use tools to artificially throttle connection
- Disable Javascript
- can you navigate without a mouse?

We believe that every user deserves equal access

3) Provide understandable content to every user

The website should act like a helpful human.

Be clear and direct
- Use simple phrasing and avoid Jargon
- Pay attention to font, spacing, line length
- Be meaningful, tools to check readability

4) Provide every user with Trust and Respect

Inclusive Design: Expluding no gender
"The easiest way to do inclusive design? Stop asking about gender!"
Sarah Leren

Collect only the info you need
-Ask "Why do we need this data?"
-Ask "What options can we give users?"
-Ask "Why should users give this to us?"

Be responsible with data
-Explain how data is used
-Explain how data is protected
-Give users control of their data
