From Specification to Collaboration; one Agency's Move to Scrum
https://2016.badcamp.net/session/specification-collaboration-one-agencys-move-scrum

This isn't a how-to talk

What they do
WHat they learned
How it's worked for our team

Problems with knoledge living nly in the brain
task bottlenecks - single POF vacaitions - n real Tribal knowledge - boardning time sucks

Etimated tickets was partial scrum, used hours due to comfort level
Hard to be accurate and high pressure for estimators
not able to learn from this process, can't iterate 

Sprint start and end cycle
Agencies have multiple clients, therefore multiple sprints
Hard to meet all promised deliveries
no clear priority structure
Not best practice, stressed everyone out
this version of scrum was constantly firefighting and it sucked
Had to change

brought in a professional to office
hired an expert
central office had a new Dedicated Scrum team - dedicated
internal champion was CEO, 
4 dedicated scrum teams meant a re-org but for the best

Unlearn what you Know! 
this was largest initial challenge

What changed?

Restructure meetings
Team involvement
Scrum Master
Story points
team testing
- these are all internal things
then go to cleints
Get client buy-in
trained them too!
-explained process and that it would be easy to learn, 2nd meeting in started to get it, after that almost all involved well

sprint week - all clients were cool with meetings moving, same day and demos on same day
4 scrum teams all in synch
know thye can finish ticket in timely way
no discrepency on antoher team start or stop

backlog grooming - not all cleints, weekly meetings only for larger complex projects
otherwise just 2 weeks normal planning

Everyone attends meetings*
transpations suck, playing telephone
cleared up communications
* sometimes can't get all in and some meetings are not in all, 

Bye-bye "telephone" - direct access - client rapoire 
Estimating in 'Annas'
Story points 
Took a couple months to get to communicate clearly, 
knew overall right direction, but fine tuning to agreement is hard to due, process but can get there
Scrum master - leader - champion - QB it. 
ticket build discussions are NOT for estimations, needs own separate meetings 

Story point delivery: pulling reports and interpreting 
helps set expectations realistic around vacations/availability
clearer to clients on what to expect

Backlog grooming
Everybody makes tickets
acceptance
cirteria
defintion of done
split tickets
make new tickets
priority-priority-priority

Don't write User Stories
What biz value does it provide? What are you really trying to provide?

JIRA
Master board for all clients
each individual client gets own board with suggestion rights, not full edit rights

How critical is it

Retrospective NOT EQUAL stitch + Bitch
time to say things upsetting you otherwise if you no talk there is no problem you see
urgent tickets treated like hot potatoes
Testing TESTING Testing

Sprint Board (not the jira ticket list)
to do
in progress (you can only be on one. can not be working on 2 tickets at once)
internal testing/review
Demo/client testing
Deploy
DONE

MOVED OFF EMAIL
Slack based communications now
filling in comments
documents as comments (hitosries are not clear enough)

Meeting that don't suck

remote collaboration!
getting better, MUST USE VIDEO
if need to talk, CALL THEM DIRECT
things get resolved earlier
How proposals changes
Put in writing
Estimates are esimations
no guarantee
COST not guarantees
Lat's talk about scrum (offer intensive version crash coarse)

Who pays for scrum?  Everyone, spread all throughout customers 
line item as strategy and planning
Scrum is about as expensive as central prject management
