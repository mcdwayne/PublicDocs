###Haters gonna Hate
++https://twitter.com/McDwayne/status/850022621034840064
Some hate mail
takes persistance to proceed, 
If you scared of failing 
We need to talk about the hate
it holds back many businesses out of fear
hate scales 1 to 1 with users/customers.
People can leverage your care against you.
Go to verizon page to see some fun hate mail
What do we do to invite hate? Anything.  Can not be avoided
Anything worth doing upsets someome.
Some things you can do
100% no questions, money back guarantee
quick turn around on refunds
Manage your expectations, can't make everyone happy
it is hard
DEALING with hater
Look for constructive critism --  got to blck out the curses and anger and read the real issue
Write a first draft, delete it - get it off your chest, then release it.  
put yourself in the hater's shoes - everyone is human, humans overreact, have bad days
Reply professionally - look past hate and address issue
working with hostage negotiaions several times a week
Deal with the stress
Use the buddy systemt o get some perspective.  
Get a team or network and leverage your peers
Engage the Happy Customers

Why he is here, - 
Despite all success and love
Still has depression.  
Life is not about finding yourself, it is about CREATING yourself.
Gotta believe and be kind

##Lawdan Shojaee - 
##Creating and Riding the Wave
Saw a need
found an icon
Went 'viral' what does that mean
pushing forward no matter what
political/business arn't supposed to mix
some clients wanted to avoid them as an entity due to politics
Sweden wanted to blast it as a national symbol
Keep riding wave, but took a lot of resources from core business
had to make a call on keep pushing forward. important.
Workshop opportunity for AmEx
Learned a lot, expanded skills
Easier to promote the idea as more known
Challenges: When do it in the company any backlash goes to team, hurdle is how much exposure for scrutiny,
Make optional to not want to, no need to justify if not want to.
Offense comes from culture, we will change culture but we need to talk about it.

##Working together; a guide for plugin developers from a friendly host
Plugin dev goes host hopping
Jump from host to host and always slow
When go into admin paes take up to 5 seconds, super slow!
plugin not tested at scale 
Plugins using SVN
Gihub is what the whole industry uses, 
Start releasing on Github, tools can help you push out through SVN for WP
think through assumptions
SIte on Pagely, get on front of Reddit
last week site went down
Oscar had to figure out what changed
they added a plugin
cookie sets and that breaks cache
Everyone makes mistakes, take responsibility
every customer is a contract
if just spare time, that is OK if you let them know that is what it is
but if sell it as professional, have to match responsibility


##Maura Teal - 
##My Journey to become a Developer
Started with questrianism
Horses scar easy

Intertwined her 
Can teach horses to belive in you
hard to understand sometimes you can do the same with people
teach to trust
Need to keep improving everyday

##Jeannette Maré - 
##Nice vs. Kind
Kindness kept her going when lost her son
she learned that kindness is super critical
Niceness is superficial 
maybe even detrimental
Kind - of a good or benevolent nature
This is overall greater good
Niceness is not always the greater good, many times quick solution
Nice definition - pleasing, agreeable, delightful
world id messier than that
Takes work and self awareness
Knowing what is going on in own brain
Empathy vs compassion -- emotional empathy vs Cognitive Empathy

##April Holle - Six P's before Profit
Purpose - affects everything, precious time, must drive you
Passion - fuel that drives you on your journey
People - the people impacted by your work, external and internal why do we care?
Problems - internal and external 
Product - the thing you do, what you are producing 
Play - impactful, adults forget how to 

##Scott DeLuzio - "Bite-Sized" Challenges
challenged himself to 50K situps and pushups
breaking down large goals to tiny steps to reach goals
story of finishing breaking down the byte sized challenge
Daily accomplishments, sense of doing something successful every day is good


##Karthikraj Magapu - Visualize future success
We have all heard about visualization
almost cliché
See yourself clearly achieving your success 
Touch and feel your success!
Write your goals down
talk to yourself everyday
be grateful, etc....
DOes it work?  Is that it?  
NO!  Why not?
visualization relaxes you and sets you back with urge to do hard work to acheive
Visualize getting over individual obstacles
Review yourself, belive in yourself, self acceptance
action plan
why does it work?
Your subconscious mind rules your life
RAS
Gatekeeper to the Subconscious
API to your brain
Reticular activation system!
everyday process 35 GB everyday
1TB every month
Use brain API to program your success!


##Chris Wallace - Recovering workaholic
Workaholism - scary to him
almost ruined him
1-Own our won time, don't let others set your schedule
protect your time
2 - Don't trade $ for promises.  Not worth it
3 - more work does  not equal more success. 
4- Protect your mental and physical health, don't ignore warning signs, 
if putting 'the future' over your health now, you will regret it
5 -replace bad habits with good ones
turning point, throwing his back out reaching for remote
that was moment realized had to get better


##Aaron Jorbin - Divorcing yourself from your ideas
every contribution matters
wear reverts as badges of honor for trying
he had record for fastest commit to revert
Divorce your ideas from you
ideas not tied to single person, 
share ideas early with your team
feedback needs to be actionable and true to be great
especially Design


##Seth Carstens - Only Hire Owners
only work with people
loyal
Pets obey, owners innovate
cow path theory
Once cow finds water, that is always the path, 
pave the cow path or don't higher cows
Be a leader not a boss
TPS reports___, don't invite this culture!
treat people like people
Character, Culture and Capability (this is the order, it is important)


##Kyle Maurer - Strategic Product Iterations
PRioritazation with a product team is rediculous and impossible
Deciding on what to do next is hard ....
typically master to do list
ship and look at next item on list, what makes biggest impoact
Common strategies for prioritizing featues
Gut feeling - flawed due to unique perspectives skewing view
Chronological-  FIFO, Flawed does not take into account emergency or tech changes
Poll/Surveys - flawed: customers normally don't have same imagination you have and price concious driven
Score based model, numerical score: flawed: tedious and complex and does not work everyone
Fight!  - hurt feeling and sometimes we all lose
But what is voice of the business?
step out of the weeds and look at what the business needs most
4 concepts of how to do this
1)All projects need these 5 things: Validation Users Revenue Savings Retention in some order
Which does your business needs most.
then ready to look at issues and tasks
2) Flaw Tolerance Scale
Tolerant to sensitive, reality of how flawed a produc are you willing to live with?
feature completeness, integrate with all browsers, etc
3) it's not jus the code
docs, sales, blogs, vids, inline docs, upsells, tooltips, social media, FAQ, testimonials, analytics, advertisements 
ID big need, COnsider stage of business, reflect on flaw tolerence remember there is more than code
listen to Get Opions Podcast :)



##Scott Bolinger - What I learned from YOU
