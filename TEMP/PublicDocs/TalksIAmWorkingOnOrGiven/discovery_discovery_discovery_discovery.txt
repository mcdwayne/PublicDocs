Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery!  The most import part of the sales process.

When a sales process goes wrong, most of the time it comes as a result of mismatched expectations.  This can be avoided for most clients by following a repeatable and thorough discovery process.  Understanding how to ask the right questions up front can mean the difference between happy clients who are eager to give you more business and nightmare clients who can never be satisfied.  

This session will focus on:
Asking the right questions
Controlling the conversation
Creating maintainable expectations  
Using discovery throughout your business
