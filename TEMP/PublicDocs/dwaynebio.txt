I have been working in tech and open source sales since 2005.  
I knew as soon as I started working with Java middleware developers I never wanted to work outside of open source ever again.  I first started building in Drupal and WordPress when I needed to build projects for the San Francisco Improv scene.  I fell in the love the community of developers and then found my position at Pantheon at the end of 2013.  
As a Community and Agency Success Manager I have had the privilege of presenting at MidCamp (Drupal), Twin Cities DrupalCamp, DrupalCamp Colorado, WordCamp Milwaukee, WordCamp Baltimore and Drupal Northern Lights (Iceland) as well as leading BOFs at several other events.  
Outside of tech I love producing and performing improv theater.  I also love comic books and karaoke!!!
