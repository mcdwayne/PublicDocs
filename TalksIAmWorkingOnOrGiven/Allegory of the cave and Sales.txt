The Allegory of the Cave and You: Best Practices from ancient Greece

Imagine it: People trapped in a dark cave but don't know they are even in a cave.  You manage to escape and see the world for how it really is, only to return to try and wake the rest of the people up only to be met with resistance of "that is not how we are used to doing things."  Technology is less about the way things were done in the past and embracing the bright sunny future with new ways of looking at problems.  This talk will compare the ages old philosophical masterpiece of Plato to the journey of development and how we can leverage the core lessions to make sure we don't get stuck in our own cave like echo chamber.  



Hopefully we all know Plato's Allegory of the Cave.  If not, read this first: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave#Summary

There are a lot of lessons we can learn that tie directly to the sales process. Let's break it into themes, like Wikipedia does:

1) Imprisonment in the cave - 
You don't know what ya don't know
we are trapped into the systems we inherit
We are in debt to the dead
we have always done it that way
If it ain't broke?  But what is broke?

2) Departure from the cave
There better be a reason
A champion/visionary is needed
This is scary stuff, lot to lose and unknown returns
Risk might kill you
Accepting that you were wrong
Seeing what is really possible
relearning to understand

3) Return to the cave
disbelief
Politics and processes
Heirachy and mindsets
they will fight and may kill you
Short term focus /focus shift needed
religious
