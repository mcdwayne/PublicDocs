Allegory of the Cave applications for sales strategy

Hopefully we all know Plato's Allegory of the Cave.  If not, read this first: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave#Summary

There are a lot of lessons we can learn that tie directly to the sales process. Let's break it into themes, like Wikipedia does:

1) Imprisonment in the cave - 
You don't know what ya don't know
we are trapped into the systems we inherit
We are in debt to the dead
we have always done it that way
If it ain't broke?  But what is broke?

2) Departure from the cave
There better be a reason
A champion/visionary is needed
This is scary stuff, lot to lose and unknown returns
Risk might kill you
Accepting that you were wrong
Seeing what is really possible
relearning to understand

3) Return to the cave
disbelief
Politics and processes
Heirachy and mindsets
they will fight and may kill you
Short term focus /focus shift needed
religious
