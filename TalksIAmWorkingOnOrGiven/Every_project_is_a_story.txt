Every project is a story: Applying storytelling to your client interactions

Humans think in stories. Every story follows a general pattern.  Once we learn to see these patterns we can more readily create new stories.  In this session we will explore these story structures and how we can use them when we deal with our peers and clients.  Learn how to translate your clients and stakeholders dreams into real plans by breaking down back of envelope designs into actionable stories. Beginners and seasoned professionals looking to level up on our human skills should attend.  

Topics will cover: 
Defining a story (The Story Spine)
Translating dreams into goals and actionable steps
Using the larger story as your roadmap
Driving your process with 'why'
