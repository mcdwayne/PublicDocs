So you want to speak at a camp?  Yes please! 

Are you going to your local meetup or regional camp and watching sessions?  Have you ever thought "I could do that" but are not sure how to get started? Well good news, this session is for you.  Speaking at camps is a great way to give back to the community and assure that your tribal knowledge gets passed on.  
Come learn the ropes with this hands on course that will guide you through figuring out what to talk about, how to submit sessions and some best practices on delivery.  

--------------------------
Have you ever explained the same concept to more than 10 people?  Guess what, that likely means you have some expertise in that field.  This 'meta' session is designed 

Why should you speak:
You know stuff you learned from other people.  
You know specifally some stuff deeply and other people want to know what you know
You want to give back to the community

Where:
Camps obviously
Meetups a great place to start
heck, just a few friends to run through


What to talk about
Topics: 
Look at your emails
What do you want to learn more deeply?
What makes you excited?
What hallway conversations have you had where you said: I wish more people knew about
What talk have you seen once that no one else is talking about?

How to submit:
Need a title, 2 paragraphs, and confidence
submit no more than 4 talks
Read the dang page and see if any of your ideas match the call for speakers (those likely more to accepted)

Slides: 
I like Google Slides but anything is good in general slides.com/keynote, powerpoint.
Just make sure you can export to PDF or are putting somewhere sharable
Clean designs work better
NO MORE THAN 3 BULLET points per slide unless you are making a point about crowded slides and information overlead.

BELIVE IN YOURSELF:
Impostor syndrome is real
you will likely never feel ready to go at your first time
if you wait to be ready, you will never go

HAVE FUN! (animated gifs)
