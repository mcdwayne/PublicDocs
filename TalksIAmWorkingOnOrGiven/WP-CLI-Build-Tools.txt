"Why Shipping Content with WP-CLI is Awesome"  - Matt Cromwell idea


Building websites by script


Why a build system
what's in it for me?
when build tools 


curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcdwayne/PublicDocs/master/NotesITookAtCampsAndBlogDrafts/StanfordDrupalCamp2018-blog-draft.txt | sed -n '1!p' | terminus wp mcdwaynedotcom.gutes -- post create --post_author=1 --post_title='Stanford DrupalCamp: The first time I have ever seen it rain in Palo Alto and a shorter camp than usual' --post_name='StandfordDrupalCamp2018' --count=1 --post_status=publish -


curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcdwayne/PublicDocs/master/NotesITookAtCampsAndBlogDrafts/StanfordDrupalCamp2018-blog-draft.txt | sed -n '1!p' | terminus wp mcdwaynedotcom.live -- post update 573 -


terminus wp mcdwaynedotcom.live -- post update 573 --tags_input='Drupal, Stanford, DrupalCamp, WP-CLI'


Test broken links
URL changes work





1. Publish content on WP page on dev-sitename.pantheonsite.com

2. ping CircleCI to fire off automation script
https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/…/rest-alert-when-new-w…

3. Export post to Github
? https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-github-sync/

4. republish to test-sitename.pantheonsite.com

assuming I can store text files as I do now, with the title as first line, it would be:
curl, 
parse first line into variable
chop off the top ( sed -n '1!p' )
terminus wp-cli generate from - (STDIN)

working manual push:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/…/StanfordDrupalCamp2018-… | sed -n '1!p' | terminus wp mcdwaynedotcom.test -- post create --post_author=1 --post_title='Stanford DrupalCamp: The first time I have ever seen it rain in Palo Alto and a shorter camp than usual' --post_name='StandfordDrupalCamp2018' --count=1 --post_status=publish -

5. upon success ping Circle to fire off behat tests to test something like URLs resolve (Form fill? Image load?)

https://www.jeffgeerling.com/…/testing-redirections-using-b… Going to need help on this part I think

6. If tests pass, deploy to live-sitename
