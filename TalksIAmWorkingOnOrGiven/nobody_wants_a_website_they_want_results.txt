Nobody wants a website.  They want results!  

How many times have you been in a situation where the client is never happy with the results, no matter what you do?  How many 'emergency' messages have you responded to because the site isn't quite right in some new way?  How many clients have you lost or fired because they honestly had no idea what they really wanted?  If you answered yes to any of those questions, this session is for you!
Gathered from years of 'learning it the hard way' I am excited to share my knowledge with Freelancers, Agency Owners, Project Managers, Business Development professionals as well as anyone else who wants to better manage conversations.  
Walk away from this talk with a better understanding of:
	- Project And Sales Pipeline Strategy
	- Uncovering Client Business Goals 
	- Objection Handling 
	- Managing Scope
	- Expectation Setting For Better Support Delivery
	
-----------
	
This is all stuff I think people at some level know, but as I have been told many times, no one says out loud.  I would ideally like to save folks in business positions and newer agencies and freelancers some pain by sharing what I went through to learn these points.

Why this?  

It's not "design a chair" its "create a way to suspend a person" -- [Kandace Brigleb](https://twitter.com/kandacerae)
[Why Customize?](https://needmoredesigns.com/wooconf17)

It's not "build a website" its "create a way (to do X) online" 

	- Project And Sales Pipeline Strategy


	- Uncovering Client Business Goals 


	- Objection Handling 
		But that is not what I want!  
		I expected X though we never discussed this before
	 	I don't care (later) OMG this is the most important part!!!!
	 	Can't you just write something up based on our emails?

	- Managing Scope
		Document, Document, Document, Document!  
		Slack and phone calls are awesome for certain things, but no records persist. 

	- Expectation Setting For Better Support Delivery
		If you can't measure it, it doesn't exist
		If it is not tied to a goal, that is outside scope
		
		
We are not designing a chair, but a human suspension system
We are not designing a space shuttle, we are designing a way to get to and from space
We are not designing a website, we are designing a _____
