Nobody wants a website.  They want results!  

How many times have you been in a situation where the client is never happy with the results, no matter what you do?  How many 'emergency' messages have you responded to because the site isn't quite right in some new way?  How many clients have you lost or fired because they honestly had no idea what they really wanted?  If you answered with a non zero number to any of those questions, this session is for you!
Gathered from years of 'learning it the hard way' I am excited to share my knowledge with Freelancers, Agency Owners, Project Managers, Business Development professionals as well as anyone else who wants to better manage conversations.
