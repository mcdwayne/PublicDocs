WCRaleigh

There were only 6 US states that I have not visited in the US when I started this trip.  New Mexico, Montana, Oklahoma, Maine, North Carolina and South Carolina.  I started my 10 day 3 city tour (link to meta post??) by crossing off NC from that short list visiting Raleigh for the first time for WordCamp Raleigh 2017.  

The only thing I knew for certain about this southern city was that it was where Andy Griffith's television sheriff character went to blow off a little steam from time to time, being the biggest city near Mayberry.  I learned a lot about this town, North Carolina in general and the awesomeness of the WP community there by going to speak and participate in this camp in it's 8th year of existing.  This year drew the largest attendance on record; over 300 tickets sold.  People came from far and wide to be there and the vibe of the camp was just amazing.

Speaker dinner: 
Almost as soon as I landed I was due at the speaker dinner.  I dropped my gear in my room and headed to the lovely Hibernian Pub in an area known as 'downtown Raleigh' (double check this).  Being a college town the location was among a strip of bars and resturants and shops that displayed a lot fo singange featuring the local NCU font and colors. It reminded me quite a bit of downtown Tempe (link to Pressnomics).  Food was a plentiful buffet of pub foods such as popcorn shrimp, beef sliders, fish and chips, quesadillas and a lonely bowl of salad (ruined by way too much cheese IMHO). I was met almost immediately by the lead organizer and GiveWP superhero Ben (LASTNAME)(Twitter link).  He made me feel right at home. It was awesome to meet many new folks as well as see a handfull of familiar faces.  With a long week ahead I embraced the 'marathon, not a sprint' ethos and was in bed at completely reasonable hour after tweaking my slides and practicing my talk.

Saturday morning was a tad unusual for me, as this was the first time I had gone to a WordCamp as a speaker but not a sponsor.  My duties were to spend a little time at the happiness bar but other than that just to be available in the 'hallway track' and meet folks. No booth to set up and run, no swag to trade for contact info, or anything else sponsor-y to do.  While I sorta liked the slight gain in sleep time this granted, it felt weird. Luckily this is a rather unusual circumstance that hopefully will repeat but rarely.  

Lunch!
Being on campus and the school having a well regarded culinary program turned out to me much to our advantage.  Since it was still spring break the lunch plan was for the venue to simply open up the food court to us.  The variation and quality of the food was better than average resturant quality with the convenience of a leisurely stroll across the well maintained and beautiful camps of the Oval campus???????????????.  Burgers, tater tots, stir frys, a taco bar, and of course BBQ were on the menus and we feasted together.

There was no food plan for the after party so we were on our own.  One of the folks I met at the happiness bar mentioned that a very creative sustainable food resturant called Fiction Kitchen was a great spot to try out locally sourced foods.  What better way to taste a new city than to gather a few folks together and eat foods grown very near there?  I was joined by a few new friends and had some of the better plant based foods I can remember.  I had the Chik'n and Waffles with a killer mushroom gravy.  One of the best things I have eaten recently. Their bar made interesting use of some unusual, to me anyhow, ingredients such as beet juice syrup, which is not overly sweet and possesses a great earthy tone.  For real, one of the better cocktails I had on my travels.

After dinner we made our way to the official after party.  I was downright shocked by the massive size of the Beer Garden.  This three story building offered over 150 beers on tap and an impressive top shelf, but the outdoor area is what impressed me the most.  Outdoor seating ran the entire length of the building and well behind it, opening up to a massive graveled acre sized plot with picnic tables, ping pong, a Bocce court and cornhole.  My favorite moment of the whole darn camp happened here.  One of my companions from dinner admitted this was her first camp and like so many folks she was a tad shy at a party where mingling was the expectation.  I buddied up with her and introduced her to the awesome folks I already knew and within five minutes she had gone from "I am going to chill here un the corner by myself" and needing to be encouraged to talk to other WordCampers, to being one of us and feeling part of the group.  If you go to camps on the regular, make sure you take some time to make sure new folks are welcomed and having a good time.  It only takes a few minutes and it is so rewarding!  
We tried to meet the call to action from @WCKaraoke to find a spot to sing but it turned out that there was much party budget left over late into the night and those drink tickets don't spend themselves.  We collectively decided to stay put and forgo the singing.  It should be noted that we all had intended to make it happen before 'the good stuff' made its way into our glasses and we were encouraged to make the most of it. The spirit of singing together was surely upheld and I had just a great time even without the songs.

Day 2 Donuts:
Sunday morning brought with it box after box after box of donuts from one of the local experts practicing the pastry craft.  While I can normally resist such temptations I will admit I gave in, much to my tongue's delight but to my blood sugar's horror.  Part of my logic is that since Sunday was a shorter program, no lunch was being provided.  With the crash, which I staved off with the amazing coffee from world renown but local to NC Counterculture Coffee.  To my surprise and joy I got to meet the owners who are using WP to better serve their growing client base.  WordPress is a great connector of content but it also connects interesting people.

Dinner was some amazing Thai/Chinese fusion with a bit of a polynesian flair with some very awesome company (find picture/tweet of that group shot)

The Sessions. 
I was thrilled that the keynote for this camp was coming from one of the more dynamic and engaging of the WP speaker pool, Chris Lema.  While we are not in agreement for choice of hosting options, I highly respect his work and thought leadership in this space.  As with many other time I have heard him speak, he dropped us into the middle of a story to start and immediatly grabbed our collective attention.  This time it was placing us at the Woolworth fire from 196????? which turned into a rousing talk that interwove multiple stories to deliver a poignant message of hope for believing in ourselves.

Lessons from
People
You
Themes

Assume the best
Listen first
-Wait 30 minutes before responding
Involve your users
Talk to users in different ways
ask better questions around what you can control
Test everything-  assumptions, code, everything, then test again
Checklists take stress off you
Try changing your perspective!
Be diverse
in revenue streams, in hiring
Research your market
Themes Lessions:
One way theming does not fit at all
Small and Big shops see success(size don't matter)
Go fast!
Find people to partner with on projects
"When in doubt- take it out"
leaving something out is easier than removing later
leaving something out is design

NC State’s “Shortcake”-Powered Design Strategy
Brian DeConinck
Really a love letter to the WP Visual Editor

https://twitter.com/georgespake/status/855851952063827968

WP in higher ed
From outside it looks stabe
really decentralized and chaotic, battles of opposing forces
WP is perfect for that
what are the problems
"I need a page that loks like this mock up"
1: sometimes best answer is just no
modern design learns from magazine design according to Jen Simmons
takes more effort and thought than can afford

If answers is not no,
2: There is a plugin that does that.
Pagebuilders are not the solution, since accessibility standards are not addressed

3: sure, let me add that template to the theme
one off thing
hard to manage
then open to the door to many one offs
cryptic names
complicated rules
What about advanced custom fields?
Still playing the this-meta-box bs again

4) Love the Visual Editor
Shortcodes and shortcake
since 2.5 not goging anywhere
if died, still all works for end users

Guettenberg is prety cool
direction going in

but what about all his work?
What about shortcode? Is it still relevant
Shortcake might not be future, but its successor is
Editor blocks API
same idea
guettenberg popup of NCU blocks?

Why should I use shortcake
1) SC olves issues right now, how long to Guettenberg?  Who knows
2) Shortcake powered shortcodes teaches new way of thinking, future way of thinking about the editor
3) you can just do some cool stuff with Shortcake now

Phone numbers build trust, provide a phone number you will answer!

Don't be too clever
ask for an email if you want an email

Dont compare
Focus on being awesome!
don't stress for what you are not, focus on what you are doing
you do you

Using docker for multi-dev/multi-platform development

https://twitter.com/nullvariable/status/855881649602560001


Lot of platforms and sites with all different requirements
 Version control
 moving between machines, docker config in the repo, carrying around requirements, it stays with the code, so booting again just there and works on Docker

Reasons Docker is not for you???
Dislike command line
Love what you have in place and it works for you (Dev matches Prod)
Special access to physical server (webcam, security dongle, etc)

OK, but is it hard?
Yes but no, but now not that hard, stable
others working it out, harder a few years ago

Let's eradicate the notion you can't takecare of yourself emotionally 
erase mental health care stigma

Get a group of people you can share with
grow with on the same journey
turning pride into gratefulness
not "I won this project" bragging but "Because we won this project we get to work together" and do..." rejoicing  

Safe group
Life support group!

Move from HTTP to HTTPS or Become Irrelevant!
Peter La Fond
basics of https and threats
interesting question form audience: "my non-profit marketing site, why does this matter?"
all should be secure, makes all more secure, shared servers especially
hackers care about the traffic not your site really, 
eavedropping
HTTPS protects people form listening in and highjacking traffic
but not all security is solved with HTTPS, need to think about security
several layers

Using Surveys To Better Understand Your Users
Frank Corso
https://twitter.com/McDwayne/status/856179367097114624


Question Bias
"Who is a wreckless driver?"
"Who has a speeding ticket?"
Asking the question that is unexpected way

user bias
you won't know evryone who answers
avoid skewing by being transparent and keeping it simple

wording a way where the user does not understand the terms
opt out choices with "I don't know" or "undecided" wherever it makes sense

User research more open ended
Great one is 
"What nearly stopped you from using us?"

Segmenting users
Questions about the questions
Example questions
how responsive has our support team been to your questions or convers
what ways can we improve
how likely to reccomend to a friend

Hotjar
 pre-sale and post sale
 useful for research surveys
Survery monkey
Forms are good too
