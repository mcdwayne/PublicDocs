I have been working in tech and open source sales since 2005.  
I knew as soon as I started working with Java middleware developers I never wanted to work outside of open source ever again.  I first started building in Drupal and WordPress when I needed to build projects for the San Francisco Improv scene.  I fell in the love the community of developers and then found my position at Pantheon at the end of 2013.  
As a Community and Agency Success Manager I have had the privilege of presenting at Stanford DrupalCamp, Drupal Northern Lights (Iceland), WordCamp Europe and many other conferences. 
Outside of tech I love producing and performing improv theater.  I also love comic books and karaoke!!!
