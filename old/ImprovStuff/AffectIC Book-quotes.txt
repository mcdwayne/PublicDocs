Affect Imagery Consciousness: The Complete Edition 
By Silvan S. Tomkins


Touch, sound, heat, light? They are constants, always present, always sources of information. How can any organism discriminate among or "make sense of" information flowing simultaneously to and from several organs and receptors? The ability to store and retrieve data from past experience is essential for the survival of the most advanced creatures, but how best should such information be managed? What aspect, what attribute of the information available to Animal's steadily increasing range of data acquisition might favor its best possible analytics? What brings, maintains, controls attention, and once it is engaged, what allows us to relinquish attention?  
Tomkins identifies nine of thes primary motivating mechanics, the inborn protocols that when triggered encourage us to spring into action.  Two feel different kinds of good and are known as the 'positive affects.' Four feel different kinds of unpleasant and are known as "the negative affects," and one other is a very brief natural reset button for the affect system.  Later he recognized two other stable forms of displeasure that he link to innate mechanisms evolved to protect us when hunger or thirst might lead us to ingest potentially dangerous substances. So great is the importance of food and the hunger drive that on a symbolic level these became protective protocols that alerted us to interpersonal danger and were therefore called 'auxiliary affects." Affect is motivating but never localizing; the experience of affect tells us that something needs our attention.  Other systems must be engaged in order to decide what must be done and how.
