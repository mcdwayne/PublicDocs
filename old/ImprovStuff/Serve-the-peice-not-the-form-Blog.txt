It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change. - Leon C. Megginson (paraphrasing Charles Darwin)

-> Theater:

Improv theater has no scripts, but most all improv you will witness follows a format.  In short form improv, like on the popular TV show 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?", we are explicitly exposed to the forms by way of introductions and direction from the host. The players simply follow the rules set forth and we get hilarious results like this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNvCm1FvCTY) Longform theatrical improv normally does not offer these bite sized explanations, instead an audience is asked for a suggestion and then the performance begins.  There are many, many different types of formats.  You can find a short, very incomplete list here (http://improvencyclopedia.org/categories/Long_Form.html)  New formats are being continually being invented too.

One of the main issues a newer improvisor faces when learning a format is they tend to focus on rigidly following the structure rather than delivering an overall good show.  This puts them 'in their head' about the order and rules, struggling to make sure they hit all the elements.  This results in them visibly starting to get more rigid and are not having any fun.  The audience really wants to see them relaxed, but instead they too start to get concerned or nervous for the performer.  Not the best of times for anyone involved.

This 'format above all' mindset steals all focus from serving the needs of the show and audience.  The best shows I have ever seen had either serendipitously aligned the form to meet the audience's needs or had completely abandoned their format by the end to make a better show.  Some of the worst shows forced a stilted format into otherwise enjoyable scenes and games, causing edits to happen too soon or way to slowly.  There is also a phenomenon where a piece has hit all the form notes faster than expected and you sill havetime left on the clock.  This leaves the actors a bit lost at what to do with the 'extra' time, or worse they just end the show early. The end result is the same, inferior shows.

"The shortest feedback loop I can think of is doing improvisation in front of an audience." said comedian Demetri Martin.   Over time, professionals learn to adapt in the moment to the audience feedback to steer the piece in real time.  This ability is what makes the art form seem so magical to so many people.

-> Development:

Just like with performance art, the goal of web development is to have a happy customer who has an awesome experience.  While it is awesome to write elegant code and follow patterns that have proven successful, I think sometimes we get so caught up with following 'best' practices or meeting internal preconceived expectations above all other goals that we can end up in fights with clients and stakeholders.


I think my colleague Tim Erikson explained the concern eloquently, "Best practices are not the only or right way to do things, only what is a really good idea based on current information."  He takes this position becaue over his life as a developer and shop owner in Minneapolis over the years he has had many argument over doing things 'the right way' based on aging best practices.  A right way means your way is likely wrong if it does not line up with the existing paradigm.  He warns that a rigid ideological approach can quickly put people at odds with our creative efforts is to find new and better ways to do things. 

For example, a colleague of mine in the security space Chris Teitzel made an observation that, we can get so caught up with 2 factor authentication, automatic password resets and ridiculously long and complex passphrase policies that the exhausted user either eventually end arounds our security or abandons the application altogether.  Remembering the goals of the project (######link to active listening########) and helping users more easily adopt good security practices (###### LINK OT MAKING OTHER PLAYERS LOOK GOOD############) will give you better results and happier customers.  

This is not an argument against learning from the past and agreeing on approaches, just let's remember that new data points regularly emerge and ideas can evolve over time.  One of my favorite talks ever is by my colleague Michelle Krejci#############, called DevOps and the Chocolate Factory: A Beginner's Guide to Automating, Testing, and Making Clients Happy (which can be viewed here: http://2016.midcamp.org/session/devops-and-chocolate-factory-beginners-guide-automating-testing-and-making-clients-happy).  In it she makes an argument that as developers we must push forward with "strong opinions, loosely held."  If a better idea comes along and the data at hand points to it as a good idea, that should become the best practice.  Just as Darwin was paraphrased, the best are the most adaptable. 


-> Exercise:

3 headed expert (word at a time expert):

Aside from teaching moment to moment adaptability concepts this game can be really fun.

You will need at least 3 players, 4 is preferred

One person plays “the interviewer”

The other three people play the “interviewee”. The only rule they must follow is that they must answer any questions one word at a time, in sequence.  Here is an example of this game being played: https://youtu.be/Xp8scfns0HU

Any leftover audience members can help by giving the interviewer a subject. At the comedy store, the usual request is for an animal and an olympic sport. The interviewee is then interviewed as an expert on that very subject.

Again go faster than you think you can.  The interviewer just has to make us questions, they don't have to make ant sense since the answers will not likely make sense either.  


-> TL;DR

In theater, when learning you follow a form, is is easy to fall into the trap of so focusing on getting it right that you no longer serve the goals of serving the audience's needs. This distresses the players and the audience as you struggle.  You have to abandon the form sometimes to serve the needs of the audience.    
In development remember the goal is happy client/stakeholders. Best practices are not the "right way" to imply you are doing it wrong, but instead they are a good idea way and we can have multiple good ideas.    
As Michaell Kreijci says: Strong opinions, held loosely.  
Adapt as the situation calls for it.
