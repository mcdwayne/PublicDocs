Welcome to the SFImprovCalendar.com

Thanks NAME###

Thanks for registering for the SFImprovCalendar.com.  It is awesome to have you on board!  

Please only post improv shows and activities.  Jams and workshops welcome. Regular classes? Let's talk.  

The only hard rule I enforce is that all events posted MUST contain a link to another site with more show info and/or ticket info.  I do not want the calendar to be a sole source of information in case show info changes.

Here is how to post: http://sfimprovcalendar.com/how-to-post
  
Other than that, have fun and feel free to poke around.  All ideas welcome.  You can even post blogs if you want (included with the account) :) 

If you want to help with any ideas, this is an open source project:
https://github.com/1dwaynemcdaniel/SFImprovCalendar

Please tell all your friends and acquaintances about the calendar.  

Now, go and log in and share your info with the world!  

Cheers and thanks again,

Dwayne McDaniel
Founder SFImprovCalendar.com
