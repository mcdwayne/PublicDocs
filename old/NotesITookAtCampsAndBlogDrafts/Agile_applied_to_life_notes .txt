Agile applied to life
@thejustinrhodes

Restaurant 
Order thrugh waiter, chef expedites ticket, marshals cooks, prep, 
Breakfast burger assembly
nasty dirty ketchen left over
well oiled team

Clients through doors - resturant as Agile
hostess = Account manager
waiter = Product owner
Meal = sprint
Order = issue ticket
items = epic

Chef =scrum master
sous chef = designer
prep = team
order rotating thing = issue tracking system

team scrambles to break through blockers
(prep cook getting powdered sugar)

Stand up - when all get together to talk about project
software = the meal itself, all parts together that is ordered
compared to original ticket

Clean up = retrospective

What about real life?
created a trello board 
scope with realistic budget and timelines
categories
-Ice box = wish list
-renovation (contractors)
-in progress 
-Done
limiting self by work in progress limited bandwith 
prioritized

Iteration and taking retrospective seriously are key to all this
will always be changes/add ons needed
