Becoming a TPM: Dos and Don'ts of Technical Project Management

Client Lion -  Need meeting and well defined expectations and education. Empathy seriously needed here. need to be able to tell them 'no' kindly

Devs need to be heads down and need you to speak their language - communicate issues to clients - feed them with properly defined task, bite sized tasks

Documentation is going to be your best friend.
Lot of communications needed and Docs are best base
Identify problems UNDERNEATH other problems.

stop people form going down Rabbit holes = unreleated issues to the larger problem.

Need to learn how to search and interpret for audience

Technical -> Project manager
stop thinking about the code that will solve issues, know person who knows the code who will solve the problems
Always delegate
If you get too far out of code, then 

Empathy comes from different expereinces than you are familiar with
read fiction
expose yourself to different ways of looking at things


Trust your gut - 

Disembodied voices are disconcerting -
Watching face and body language
really cultivate reading body language

Understanding balace - clients need with Dev skill set
