- Disable Overlay
Multiple page reloads
overlay is JS dependant, issues galore
Useless use-case

no power user features
Enable admin menu

Should I use Mega Menu?
no for novice users
Content managers no

icons are important because less is more and near universal (can be) not relying on language

Luxury Lanes

nav-friendly
mobile friendly
