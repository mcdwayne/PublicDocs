### Friday Keynote

[Learning @ Work](https://2018.drupalcorn.org/session/keynote-learning-work)
[Tiffany Farriss](https://twitter.com/farriss)


Raw Notes:
What lasts? 
What can ROman Contrete teach us
centries old, but hol up better than modern
Palentir - she became CEO, more than a title change
Operational side is part of it
allowed her to focus how they deliver
Putting things out there and see change happen as things are shared
Success of a company is based on people, who leave, which happens sooner than you think
Average tenure at tech is 3 years
how do we succeed together?
A Sr. only hiring strategy is problematic for multiple reasons
Everyone loves supergroups, but they do not last long
not a strategic choice for a company
not sustainable
Sr. only strategy gives no advantage, then you are just a vector to getting short term teams together of rock stars
also perpetuates inequality
missing out on the pipeline and retention problems we already have
diverse teams outperform uniform groups
represent the people we are serving
Culture, the way we do things around here"
pattern of basic assumptions
needs to have a lens of past experience where we understand the past
a **learning organization** is an org skilled at creating , acquiring, tranferring knowledge and at modifying its behaviour to reflect new knowlege and insights
Individual learning is different.
taking individual lessons and boiling it up for long term team knowledge
Affirm, Inform, Transform
Iteration on how things work is super important
this is what good journalism does for us
Transformational leaders can see the advantages of tech changes
Napoleon, Waterfall approach to war
attrition warfare
'to grind down' losses are staggering, really bad for people
losses on both sides about equal
one side breaks rank, they lose position and resources and then lose
Napoleon kind of invented agile
decisive victory, with as few resources as possible
He invented Maneuver warfare, confuses decision making ability
cannonballs were not standard sizes, got that solved and they got better
faster to deploy and worked everywhere
punch through cavalry lines and infantry as a spear, 
made a playbook that he gave to his lieutenants 
Napoleon had first mover advantage
adjusted per situation
leveled up his combined arms approach
no new tech, just combined tihngs differently
different mental model
taking responsibility 2000 individual websites vs building a platform
easier to do individual sites, you can do it in a day
faster to set up that way
takes a lot more complex modeling and collaboration to pull off a platform
in cases of scale, generates efficiencies
Drupalgeddon - solved in 5 minutes
but greater initial investment
must create a culture that promotes learning
our educational system comes from Napoleon's idas in the Prussian system
emphasize a good soldier strategy 
obedience, duty, diligence, reading and writing and maths
this is elevating a tactic and elevating to a strategy
in the US system, same thing, gave rise to obedient factory workers
works great for highly structured jobs, like manufacturing
most of us are knowledge workers here at DrupalCorn
Solving things that can't be solved by computers
don't let the robots take our jobs, require critical thinking
only some people thrive in autonomous situations 
how do we enable people to do this
"deeper learning" said IBM in the 80s
National research council created charts defined:
Cognitive, intrapersonal, interpersonal 
Fixed vs Growth mindset
no one controls where we start
growth says you can learn and work hard at it
hard work makes you smarter
not about who you are
Michael Jordan became the best at practice
first in, last out, focused on fundamentals
Company needs to demonstrate a genuine belief in human development
open to receiving feedback and you give them training
talk about all skills as learnable
hire Jr. people and let people do new things
present managers as resources for learning
Perfect practice makes perfect
Malcom Gladwell - don't waste your time with his book
10,000 hour rule
Pot Roast story
little girl, saw mom cut ends of pot roast, asks why
her mom didn't know why, learned from her mom, asked grandma, she didn't know, asked great-grandma, she had to to fit it in her old pan
not all practice leads to improvement
Nieve practice - play mindlessly
not getting any better this way
even 10,000 hours does not make you improve, automated ability
Orgs don't just 'get better' takes work
quality and quantity of practice matter
everyday skills - arrested development - expert performance
experts don't waste time examining small pieces, they work in patterns
 they see things as units
Double loop learning
blame game a lot, smart people do not like to be wrong
OSS is fairly used to single loop learning
try smarter, not harder
like Scrooge McDuck
if leadership can't create "psychological safety", not going to build trusting teams that can succeed
Members of a team:
 * respect each other
 * interested as each other as people
 * not reject for who you are
 * trust one another to have good intent
manifested as:
 * seeking and giving feedback
 * making changes and improvements (don't stik to a bad course too long)
 * obtaining or providing help or expertise
 * experimenting
 * engaging in constructive conflict or confrontation
Deliberate practice
creating the expert
have to become an expert then an innovator
important to mentor to gain even higher level of expertise

[A Introduction to Gulp](https://2018.drupalcorn.org/session/introduction-gulp)
[Tim Erickson](https://twitter.com/StPaulTim)


Raw Notes:
Some people in room use it, some don't know what it is
Goals for today: 
* share tools
* demystify some tools
* have a discussion 
* learn new things
how he got here
1. D7 - EN theme
no sass, Sass with compass, Sass with Gulp
Preprocess CSS and work with Variables
automate CSS building from files
didn't fully understand what was happening behind the scenes
2. D8 - SASS or LESS with Grunt
3. in Backdrop - Themes are very different - no sass or Less
Gulp Watch on D7
just want to make sure theme processes correctly (ignoring errors)
began experimenting, SASS in Backdrop
Wanted to use GULP in Bootstrap
get rid of the mess
What is Gulp?
Toolkit that automates painful, time consuming tasks in dev around workflow, so you can stop megging around and build something
[https://triplo.co/gulp](https://triplo.co/gulp)
npm package
What can you do with it?
compile SASS...and more (missed slide)
` npm install -g gulp`
create
Live Demo!
Create package.json and composer.json

### My Session

[Let's learn Git. No more excuses.](https://2018.drupalcorn.org/session/lets-learn-git-no-more-excuses)



[A Drupaler's Guide To Marketing](https://2018.drupalcorn.org/session/drupalers-guide-marketing)
[Drew Gorton](https://twitter.com/dgorton)

Raw Notes:
More money spent on websites than ads
websites are the biggest marketing spend
breaks down ecosystem
wix to Drupal to Adobe
WP used by practitioners
Adobe is top down CMO decisions
Drupal is getting squeezed in the middle
google search prompting tells us there is a problem
the sales/marketing funnel
Awareness, interest, decision, action
many, mnay players and moving peices of marketing
CMS is just a tiny fraction of the landscape
digital marketing lots of tech, many measurements
many acronyms
All easy,, learn 9 today
tools to understand the rest
CTR - Click through rate
2000 visits/5000 impresions= 4% CTR
CPC - Cost per CLick
2000 visits/$1000
$.50 PCP
CPL Cost per lead
$1000/80 newsletter (for example)
CPL = $12.50
are these good?
It depends, need to compare to history
compare to peers
CAC - Customer Acquisition cost
NNN - Net New Names
MQL - Marketing Qualified Lead
CLV/CLTV/LTV - Lifetime value
S/ME - Sales/Marketing Efficiency
	For every $ spent - how many new $ come back
MoM - Month over Month
"CPL is down 35% MoM" example
There Acronyms seeems confusing at first, can take some time to parse
but very doable
this all makes reporting easy
track progress over time, KPIs can improve
Sharing things you care about does not always work
"We typically improve our client's Cost per LEad (CPL) by 15%"
this explains value in their terms
very interesting is their KPI metrics
measured things, shared insights, simplify reporting

[Katherine Shaw](https://twitter.com/katannshaw)

Raw Notes:
(came in a touch late)
List of terms 
A11y
Sematic - signifiers between symbols
HTML Code sniffer is the tool she uses.  Bookmarklet 
Screenreaders are also important
see slied for list of all these
PEAT Photosensitivity Epilepsy

[Demystifying Diversity and Inclusion](https://2018.drupalcorn.org/session/demystifying-diversity-and-inclusion)
Presenter(s): volkswagenchick, Presenter(s): cotterpinx 


How are things all the same, tend to get more of what you got
but how are they different
making an effort to respect those difference is diversity
If we are talking about D7y in people
look at all the attributes of a person, not just one
more like this vs you may also like
More like this, optimizes simliarities
looking beyond what is most similar
We need inclusion not just integration, or assimilation
intersectionality
treating people fairly means treating people with same result not same standard
Equality vs equity vs justice
Inclusive language - words matter
Parent, not mother or father
difference between sexual orientation and gender, but we are not talking on that today
pronouns can not be assumed
community, how do we do it?
Start with job descriptions: watch for 'coded' language that teds to appeal to specific groups and excludes others
think about process.  Does it give advantage to certain people
Can you learn from it and move on
foster inclusivity at events?
Families, 
neuro-diversity 
people with disabilities
19 year olds, what do they do?
Call for Papers
to have a more diverse speaker line up - you may need to invite a diverse range of speakers
Include a Diversity and Inclusion section in the CFPs
'lift and center their voices'
Accessible Presentations 
font size and weight, 
content placement, 
contrast, 
slide effects, 
visual content that needs to be described, 
mic or not?
inclusive body language
Be an ally
sharing pronouns
DD&I slack channels in Drupal
Local Accessibility meetups
Volunteer at local camps, meetups, and DUGs

### Saturday Keynote 

[How to Fall in Love with Drupal Again](https://2018.drupalcorn.org/session/keynote-how-fall-love-drupal-again)
[Matt Westgate](https://twitter.com/mettamatt)

Drupal Song
15 years of Drupal
Lullabot founder and Tugboat and Drupalize.me
Act 1 Falling in love with Drupal,
Act 2 Falling out of love with Strual
Act 3 Falling in love with Drupal again
Core values of Drupal
* Be Human
* Collaborate Openly
* Have Fun
* Kick Ass
Used to have World Book Encyclopedia
year in review book annual
one day brought a computer home and encylcopedia got dusty
56K modem
Yahoo was his now encyclopedia
Saw source code and freaked out, fell into it
ended up on [pagetutor.com](http://www.pagetutor.com/index.html)
old school, notepad and HTML
taught HTML at library on his own
this is all around year 2000
Windows98 were available Apache, PHP, MySQL
Started a web company, Moment Design
built his own CMS
WYSIWYG editor, more time fixing pug than building features
started to resent the software he made
yahoo took him to Drupal.org next
didn't get it at the time
came back to it later, the more read about the Node system
first project where he saw good documentation and modular architecture
emailing patched back and forth
maintainer text file, he got to be a part of it
Met John van Dyke in the etemology
fixed computer bugs for advancement of real bugs
John became his first Drupal mentor
wrote the first D book
Threw first get together in Antwerp
Acquia FUD
worry Acquia was the first large commercial factory
would they make their own closed 
fought it,
was just being scared, it didn't signal the end
JS came through
Drupal 7 changed things
Drupal's place became the place for large scale digital experiences
not for the hobbies small projects anymore 
He burned out, sold his stuff and went to a monastery
Learned to understand suffering
come from a place of abundance
Acquia made it easier to choose Drupal as Enterprise CMS
yes, And... thinking leads to better collaboration
You matter more than the cause
Jeff Eaton's talk at DrupalCon Nashville
it is easy to lose yourself in a good cause because you are passionate
Drupal is people too
Watched a lot of people, 
Creating Healthy Culture of Expectation
* Don't glorify death marches
* Don't punish boundries when people exercise them
* If you notice signs of burnout in others, help
* Do more than Drupal 
Life is the stuff that happens while you're waiting for moments that never come

[Making Search Work](https://2018.drupalcorn.org/session/making-search-work)
[michael.smith@vml.com](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mas5d2/)


We normally think of search as an afterthought
need to question the need
6 page marketing site, not real need for search
firs ting people think of we think at Google
everyone expects their site to be as good as Google and their 1000000 engineers
and enormous amount of data
Go to a site, look for careers
cmd+f (if not there, that is not good)
put it on the page
next: google - vml careers
google already does it, on small case just don't put search?
good intuitive nav
Can I build my site without search? - keep asking
Spire website (natural gas)
Natural Language Navigation
just fake it and it suggests the best things
What do we want to search?
just content and titles only?
content type audit is needed
only search for full URLs, if no way ot get to taxonomy page, no use
after understanding which entity types
example 4 different indexes on a page - summary page
search by index?  Multiple searches?
sort by is important as well
relevancy is score from search term, number of times it appears mostly
Sometimes want to see recent, not relevant
want to make sure it can be themed
what do you want items to look like in a search result?
Tyson food site example
Mobile users matter, don't just think desktop
Infrastructure
Now we are sure we need search and know what to search
let's Setting it up
Strategy 1. No search
Strategy 2. create indexes, not as fast as Solr and not as advanced at all
no distance or location services, but it works
Drupal.org uses DB search, set up right
Strategy 3. Solr - best in Michael's opinion
Apache project
different search algorithms
Works well with Pantheon and Acquia
Strategy 4.  all other options, ElasticSearch, Algolia, legacy Google Search Appliance
many more with APIs
Search API module ties it all together
lot of plugins for backend and front end
servers and indexes are outside Drupal and need to set all that up
Solr - need a service 
again, Pantheon and Acquia have a service
Or go find it hosted, WebSolr (+1), Searchstax, OpenSolr
locally, you can set it up quick with Docksal
really quick and easy setup 
Solr schema.xml file
it says what we can search for 
found in the search_api.solr Drupal module
<--distracted-->
Views for solr environment
delay, default is 2 minute delay before query is available once uploaded
tab shows schema file
after set up server, 
select bundle - the content types
not scanning the site every search, passing that to index, just searcing index
