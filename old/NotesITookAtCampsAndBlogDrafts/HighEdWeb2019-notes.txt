HighEdWeb 2019: Milwaukee in the fall is cold but we didn't have that far to walk

On a train is how I arrived to ['Cream City'](https://www.wuwm.com/post/how-milwaukee-got-nickname-cream-city#stream/0) from Chicago, my near future home as of when I am writing this. I was in the windy city acquiring an apartment for the upcoming year as I move some things around in my life and it seemed really silly to fly between the cities when you can drive in less than 2 hours. It turns out you can take a train for $25.00 each way and it has free wifi good enough to read news and check email.  This was the first time I had returned to ['Brew City'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_city_nicknames_in_Wisconsin), home of [The Bronze Fonz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Fonz) was way back before this blog was a thing for WordCamp Milwaukee 2016. I forgot all about it until I got here and no old post to remind me how good it was in so many ways.  I was excited for a few reasons but the biggest was this was my last scheduled talk and workshop for the whole year, which I was giving at [HighEd Web 2019](https://2019.highedweb.org/)

## Food and Fun

Before I dig into the day by day play by play, I need to tell you about the Polka Button.  Yes, you read that right, a [Push To Play Polka button](https://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/39662). It does exactly what it says too. You push it, an announcer says what band and song and it plays that good time feeling music for all ages to dance to for a few minutes.

### Saturday

I arrived a day early and not much was going on for event stuff but there seemed to be a natural gathering of folks at [Miller Time Pub and Grill](https://milwaukee.millertimepubandgrill.com/). I made my way there and immediately saw a few people I knew and raised a glass with them. It was also good to meet a few new people as well.  I returned to this place a few other times, but this will be it's only linked inclusion for the post.

### Sunday

A late start to the day meant the day started with lunch. And what a lunchroom it was. The speakers and workshop attendees gathered in the [Crystal Ballroom](https://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/wisconsin/hilton-milwaukee-city-center-MKEMHHF/event/index.html) at the official convention Hotel, the Hilton, for a buffet of salad, soup and potato.  

https://twitter.com/leowebdevo/status/1183424754474192896


As the day ended with the Orientation, which I will discuss later under Sessions, we walked over to the ["Welcome Reception"](https://2019.highedweb.org/special-events/) at the [Milwaukee Public Market](https://milwaukeepublicmarket.org/). This is a grand space with many vendors. It feels like someone went to Pike's Place market in Seattle and rebuilt just the good parts in Wisconsin. I had too many different awesome things to name them all, but will cite the vegan ice cream from [On The Bus](https://www.onthebusmke.com/) as outstanding. 

https://twitter.com/HighEdWeb/status/1183538600589299712


### Monday

Unlike any other conference I have been to in my travels, this one offered a formal "let's all sit down together" kind of breakfast experience. I had coupons all week for a special dietary meal which fed me tofu scrambles and many other delectable things. Meanwhile, others ate a lot of bacon. This conference is known for this apparently. The quality of the coffee was pretty good, so much so that I never even bothered to look at the tea selection too closely. 

https://twitter.com/McDwayne/status/1183733538086146050


While I was surprised at the breakfast it did set expectations high for lunch and I have to say they delivered on it very well.  Same as the breakfast, I presented my ticket and they brought me a soyrizo stuffed pepper that was mighty tasty.  

https://twitter.com/ColB/status/1183806826170765315


One more time we gathered at Miller Time for an end of day relaxation drink and social hour.  

https://twitter.com/funnelback/status/1183947176277352449


And then we went to the unofficial party at [Up-Down MKE](https://www.updownarcadebar.com/milwaukee/), an arcade bar stuffed with well maintained classics, modern awesomeness and some rarities I have never seen in person ever before. The one that sticks out the most is a rare box called ['Ice Cold Beer'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cold_Beer). Giant Jenga and some other non-video cabinet games were around as well. A very good night overall.

### Tuesday

Breakfast was as good on the second day as it was the first with another tofu scramble thing. Coffee was on par too. Lunch was a repeat mostly but with a pastry replacing the pepper. I like the idea of all eating together in one room and then having the next part of the day be in the same large room, as they did here [if you look at the schedule](https://2019.highedweb.org/schedule/#daily-tuesday). It feels efficient and keeps the whole conference going as one unit.  


The big after party for the event, which they call the [BIG SOCIAL EVENT](https://2019.highedweb.org/special-events/) took place at the [Milwaukee Art Museum](https://mam.org/), one of the finest collections of modern art and most striking buildings on the planet.  We were given free access to the exhibits and we had some light snacks, beer and wine. There was even a fireworks show for the event!

*At the BIG SOCIAL EVENT, they had live band karaoke!* They hired a band called ["Live Band Karaoke Milwaukee"](http://www.livebandkaraoke.net/) to do it. Everyone had an amazing time but we were not done singing for the night.

#### Karaoke Plane
Now, I have heard of this before and was supposed to crash it last year in Sacramento, but got sick and couldn't make it over there from SF. This year I was the first singer singed up as people just started arriving and it was amazing! I wish every event I went to had this kind of group singing tradition.  We gathered at the really cool spot [Tavern at Turner Hall](https://tavernmke.com/), which was super comfy and cozy but very large and accommodating at the time time.  A remarkable time that ended only when the venue finally forced everyone out with the flood lights that bars use to shoo patrons.

### Wednesday

Breakfast and coffee were repeats, but boy howdy was it great.  At the end of breakfast they announced the Red Stapler Award winners who would have to give their talk again this day. This is a mixed thing. It is great to be honored for an award, but having to repeat a session when you are exhausted is just a chore. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I did not get one of these awards.  It was right before the keynote, after the session has been represented, that they gave the actual Red Staplers out.  Lunch followed and that ended the day and the event for me.

## Sessions

[Orientation](https://2019.highedweb.org/schedule/#daily-sunday)

There was a very friendly and welcoming orientation session where I learned about half the people attending were also first timers. I wish more events had these type of welcoming sessions. It really made me feel more connected and less like an outsider as this was my first HighEd Web as well.

[Escaping the Data Doldrums: Transforming basic analytics into holistic data-driven decision-making](https://2019.highedweb.org/session/escaping-the-data-doldrums-transforming-basic-analytics-into-holistic-data-driven-decision-making/)
[Sean Flynn](https://twitter.com/wxgeek)

This was a very no-nonsense talk about collecting real data into reports for deciding on actions. Sean laid out very succinctly what tools he uses and why. Striving for automation is great, but striving for automation of meaningful reporting is the best.  He also addressed SMART goals, like a few others did as well, which I love and think we should talk about even more. The second half of the talk, about how to wisely use the data is the real star of the talk though. Just having data means nothing if you can't connect it with how people receive data and act on it. He ended on [an XKCD joke](https://xkcd.com/937/), so this talk got my highest praise in my evaluation.


Raw Notes:
not about coding today 
What covered
building foundation-ally sound analytics Building Data infused decisoin making culture
data can't tell you what you strategy should be
without data we are working in the dark,
we should drive the process
Lot of unreacted data today
data sources
GA/Tag manager 
Salesforce Marketing Cloud
Social Media Sources
G/A Basic web analytics
event tracking via GTM
ecommerce tracking for a giving site
Twitter Analytics
export data button to get a CSV
FB has data export function as well, but exports excel, not CSV
Automated Instagram reporting
they ended up running the school's LinkedIn account
turned out LinkedIn is most engaged audience
Salesforce marketing Cloud
emails - sends deliveries, etc
does require some manual, not 100%
URL builder
UTM tagging - without this working, not as useful data
dev team built a UTM building tool, made it way easier to track links once made easy
Reporting?
they started in hand typed Adobe inDesign docs
weekend to build it
no automation of daily entry, no auto comparisons
hard to read and no real insights exposed easily
Meet Google data studio 
Rapid visualization and reporting
eam based permissions
easy rapid visualization
examples of output
tiny.cc/heweb19tea1
advancement.wm.edu/analytics
Social summary gives very clear view of which platform  most engaged, LI
tracking texts vs calls
Data cleaning is the most important and most time consuming step manually
pt. 2
Building a Data Infused Culture
culture change is hard and frustrating
Basic analytics flow
communications->visitors->reported
In reality
stale comms strategy
frustrated audience
data
never ending meaningless reporting-> frustration
what is missing?
institutional support, stakeholder buy in
data infused decision making
this is the feedback that improves and closes that loop frustration turns to improvements
but how did they get there?
Slow uphill climb, no easy answers
1. analytics subject matter expert (SME)
2. build rapport with colleagues, TRUST builds everything
3. aim for small victories early, then build on them - small stuff builds trust
4. set SMART Goals
becoming the SME
immerse yourself in data
admit when you don't know things
prize credibility above all - if you're not sure say so. if you need more time to give  good answer, say so
saying you don't know, when you don't know, builds trust
Build rapport
seek first to understand, then to be understood
You need to know both analytics and your colleagues missions and priorities
Get people on your side informally reaching out to friendly colleagues
sit in on meetings, the more you know the better
Aim for small victories
in early days especially: limit scopes of your projects
clearly define scope and terms of success/failure
A/B testing small web design changes (use Google Optimize)
story of breaking button on mobile, hurt donations
find easy visible wins that don't break things
build on small tings
SMART goals
email example
email is primary communication tool
they wrote a LOT more email than they thought they did
only started tracking 
most people about 127 times
179 most
just from advancement.
raised 4.7 million through online giving, email solicitation
if increase overall click rate 
not an easy sell not achievable
data suggested sending less emails
can't just cut emails in half
seems right but not a SMART goal now
efficiencies
combine emails
consider alternative channels
aggressively segment emails based not just on affinities, but on previous response to emails and drop highly responsive and non-responsive alumni
example homecoming emails
Pitfalls to avoid:
Discovering huge issues and being overwhelmed and taking on too much
suppress the urge to shout your discoveries from the mountaintop, be methodical
You'll know your data better in a year than you will in those first few months, even better after 2 years
Change takes a long time and dedicated effort

[Marissa Gentling](https://twitter.com/MarissaGentling)

At the heart of her talk, full of examples of her methodologies in action, she breaks down 4 types of stakeholder and client.  I have not hear of these 4 groups before, but it makes a lot of sense.  The groups are The Enthusiast, The Investigator, The Loyalists (aka The Confused), and The Challengers. Her slides are a better resource for this than my scant few notes but I would love to dive into this theory more.  


Raw Notes:
400 hours of video uploaded to FB every minute

Consolidates pages to eliminate duplication
have you ever heard: 'Just put this on the web'
it does not work with the site
She had a request who explained down to her how web worked
read between the lines
understand the needs of and goals of both internal and external customers
start with what is important
Who are customers
internal
colleagues goals
external
anyone using the site
target audience
why web governance
hands in different directions square vs circle
same directions easy
Franchise meets mom n pop
franchises are all about trust, same experience no matter who runs it
web services 'mcdonaldized' standardized services and templates
'mom-n-popinized' the delivery
so what now
some people don't care or just lack understanding
some people work just different
basic principles of change management
make connections/build relationships
use evidence and data to support recommendations
people don;t buy what you do, they buy why you do it
start with why they should do or want something
trust brings change
bust how to build trust if time is limited or scarce resource?
and what about the skeptics?
Kendall Lee example
her customer
another one made first successful face transplant
types of customers
the enthusiast - dive into research to show how things improved
Investigator - questions validity
Loyalists (aka confused)
Challengers
How to know?
see her slides for example emails from each
which one are you?
learn how you: absorb info, make decisions, give feedback and receive it
Establish Credibility
provide evidence be authentic
be human
Share the what
Share the processes and policies establishes for the website
with Leadership
internal intranet site
lunch and learns (buy it and they will come)

[Once Upon A Time, I Wrote My First Hello World](https://2019.highedweb.org/session/once-upon-a-time-i-wrote-my-first-hello-world/)
[Elyssa Naval](https://twitter.com/ElyssaNaval)

As someone who does not read session descriptions too closely ever, I really thought this was going to be a talk about her life journey to being a web developer. It kinda was, but in all reality it was a talk about cognitive bias and how to deal with it.  Many a good take away from the talk but the one that distracted me while she was talking was her talking about [Userinyerface.com](https://userinyerface.com/) which you should open in a new tab, otherwise you might not remember to come read the rest of this.  

Raw Notes:
last year at California State Railroad Museum
Found a wall full of index cards with questions
she wrote down she wanted to be a SME on web design
working towards that goal
Curse of Knowledge
cognitive bias assumes they know same background knowledge
learning to cook with her dad

hard to learn because you don't know the background info
sister wanted to "Buy a developer"
she was talking about beauty supply
project needs and requirements get messed up due to project vocabularies misaligned
importance of MVP and feedback project
swing analogy

Empathy Gaps
Are we really designing for the users
client vs user view

[Get. Stuff. Done.](https://2019.highedweb.org/session/get-stuff-done/)
[Day Kibilds](https://twitter.com/kibilds)

This talk was all about optimizing how you do some of the basic things in office life, like keep notes in a sane fashion and how to actually, without as much pain as it sounds, schedule meetings with any number of people. This one also won a Re Stapler and was repeated and both times there was a packed house. I personally think the Super Mario Bros. 3 theme throughout her deck had something to do with that, because come on, that is like one of the best games of all time. Lots and lots of little nuggets in this one to implement right away no matter where you work or what you do.  


Raw Notes:
jack of all trades
learned to do the mundane stuff
emails people will read, taking notes, around the cool work that we do
stuff that sends us to happy hour
Not a PM talk, 
journey
pile of docs for admission example
instead of dealing with lists of things and bad search
using a wiki
search-able, tag-able, browsible, mobile
vertically and tagging across 
click on tags to learn more
downloads docs and forms
screenshot 
when you set up a wiki, set it up with growth in mind
version nightmares
naming hell
use the cloud, one location, versions saved, can access control
sharepoint file 
Date format YYYYMMDD
no letters for months in file names
pick your battles
scheduling meetings
scheduling flowchart
(find it online)
never ask 'what works best for you'
give two options and only 2
notes shared documents
team meetings and agenda and notes
Use shared docs to take important meeting notes
action items
names first, change color
if people are not reading what you write, it is 100% your fault
should this be a meeting or trainings?
use bold and white space
large, color, whitespace!
Stop being polite
be polite at top and bottom, rest of email is
Fact, Fact, Action, Action, Fact
write like you speak
if only 2 seconds, remember what you want them to see or do
Manage your projects

I have known Paul for a while and he was the one that encouraged me the most to submit technical intro talks to HighEd Web in the first place.  I have seen him give presentations before and I knew he was good. Seeing this presentation about his overarching work at [Mizzou](https://missouri.edu/) though put it all in a new light for me. He and his team are literally fighting uphill and performing tranformative miracles over there. For shear inspiration that with perseverance you can do anything, there are few better examples I can point you to than this session. Also there were the best cat gifs of the whole event in the slides.  This talk won the Red Stapler for its track, so it is not just me bing nice here, this was outstanding.   


Raw Notes:
Decentralized
set up standards but could not enforce them
not authority to
herding cats
difficult to support
Conflicts between Central IT, devs and Admins
not in sync
waiting for funding a lot to fix specific issue

### Red Stapler Winner
[Be the MVP of Managers](https://2019.highedweb.org/session/be-the-mvp-of-managers/)
[Joel Vertin](https://twitter.com/jcvertin)

I missed this talk the first time around and was very glad this won a spot in the ['Session Repeats by Red Stapler Winners'](https://2019.highedweb.org/schedule/#daily-wednesday) which is a 'best of show' award where the session is performed one more time.  Given that it is on the last day, after a few nights of revelry, and certainly after the most intense one, this is a mixed honor in my opinion. The talk was a mile a minute kind of great idea after great idea, butt it boils down to 'be a good human and help others be good humans.' This is one, that if the recording exists, should be sent to anyone with a manager or director title.

###[KEYNOTE: ERIK QUALMAN](https://2019.highedweb.org/keynote/)

It is not everyday that you get to see someone who has been on every talk show on the planet and who is such a widely read author. There was a buzz of excitement in the air as Erik took the stage and he followed through with an amazingly well thought through presentation that inspired and challenged the room to go out and focus on doing what you do well even better.  I have not read his books before, but I now have one on deck in my Audible. He had an interactive part that asked for us to email him and he emailed me back. That is a classy move and will stick with me for a while as a great way to engage, really engage, with an audience.

### My Sessions

[Pre-Conference Workshop: Let’s Learn Git: No More Excuses](https://2019.highedweb.org/session/lets-learn-git-no-more-excuses/)

I love teaching mostly because there is no other feeling in the world than seeing the lightbulb come on in someone's eyes when they first truly grasp a new idea.  This session was full of such little moments and I am delighted to the nth degree by it. I am so proud that some people came in the room without having downloading Git before and left the room having successfully done a pull request on a forked repository. Together we [built this site](http://highedwebgittraining.club/), though you can 100% blame me for the CSS choices you don't like. This felt like the best way to spend my Sunday I could have spent and made the whole trip worth it for me personally.

[Bash Is Magic # No It’s Not](https://2019.highedweb.org/session/bash-is-magic-no-its-not/)

If even one person left the room thinking "I can do this command line stuff after all What was I afraid of?" then I did my job. I want to empower the world by helping people unlock the power at their fingertips. I learned so much giving this talk, which I am going to retire as a session or at least retool based on what I have learned giving it.  So thankful to all the people that helped make giving this possible and who believed in me.

Now that I am winding down the conference tour circuit life I think I might take this content and make it more consumable by way of videos and community outreach efforts in my new home city.  I want everyone to delight in the simplicity of using command line and version control, which give you superpowers!  

## Wrapping Up

It was an event of connecting with folks from a slightly different walk of life from me, which to be honest made me feel like a bit of an interloper from time to time. Luckily those thoughts were always chased out of my head by a friendly voice and an encouraging word. I, myself, am not in higher ed, I will always be in awe of the folks who give their lives for educating the future generations. The unsung heroes of the fight who made sure the website stayed up and that the content was accessible to all are the ones getting the job done for the kids and for our future world leaders. I count it among the highest honors to have been part of this event and hope that, perhaps if circumstances reveal themselves to be correct, I will get another chance to come and be part of this event again. Maybe even in Little Rock next year for [HighEd Web 2020](https://2020.highedweb.org/)
