PROFITABLE WEBSITE PROJECTS â€“ THE OREO COOKIE STRATEGY


Change your thinking
Not advertising, complex software dev

Planning is not optional or 'nice to have'

It's not an oreo without the crunchy outside
Put as much thought into dev as design

Planning - 
Projects don't fail at the end, they fail at the beginning

Discovery to Document everything before you start

WHat is objectie? 
Functional req, technical req, Determine the architecture

Plugins are awesome but they do things a certain way.  Nee to plan before implementing
Otherwise you start customizing code to fix 

Present everything in wireframes

Design...(the gooey center of the oreo)
this is where budget goes off rails
no contraints - gets very inefficent
review wire frames with Devs
Early and often

Provide design for all pages and functionalities

Mobile first - responsive vs adaptive

Development (more crunchy bits)
Let the developers drive the build

Follow review process

Manage changes - and expect changes

Clients, don't bring a knife to a gun fight

conversation does not equal scope

Agencies - Charge for your work.  
Charge for discovery!  It's worth a lot
A solid foundation saves everyone time and money

Discovery also makes 

Ask for the budget - money up front ideally bank

charge for project management
and set boundries - some need a lot of help

Charge for training and docs
it takes time and draws on your IP

Change orders are your friend
"Anything can be done with enough time and budget"
the HGTV strategy

Document the scope in Discovery

changes either change order or included in phase 2 planning

Track time, even if a fixed bid
- do you really know how long it takes

Define a post launch grace period in the SOW an then charge for support

charge for content entry
you can do it faster then the client can and that is worth something


What you need for a profitable webste dev

Clear and documented understanding of requirement
a site map and wire frame to communicate the site structure and functional requiorements

a solid thought through design
