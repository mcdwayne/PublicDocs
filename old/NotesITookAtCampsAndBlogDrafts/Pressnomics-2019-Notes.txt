[The Ethics of Open Source.](https://pressnomics.com/#schedule)
[Morten Rand-Hendriksen](https://twitter.com/mor10/)

Why are we here in OSS
why don't you just walk away
a think in his head that he can help
make the world better
Grew up with "Do what makes you happy as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else or yourself"
this is a huge part of his social community
OSS was a natural transition
then he was in HS, Guidance counselor
Philosophy 
there was something that he could not put his finger on something in the world
communication and somehow move that idea into another person's head without breaking the process
what equity and the common good is
Dugnad - Norway word
term for community getting together to make the community better
purely selfless act
building playgrounds en dugnad
this concept is built into how Norwegians define themselves
Multi-faculty informatics 
had a professor who called it
stupid socialist BS called OSS
briefly covered it
JS was a waste of time
the 4 freedoms
OSS is the equity and the common good
Back in 1985 this was super radical manifesto
where is the money in this?
software tax?
what you can do with it and the time spent doing it
2019, OSS runs the world
but the ideology does not scale to the sizr it became
society didn;t change with the revolution
WP how doe we put money into the OSS and control it
he feels personally onboarded 1M people to WordPress
he has numbers to prove it
the thing to control your prosense online 
Trust it and trust the community
now due to the scale
distance between the user and the project growing
learn react or some version of react
no longer bult by the community of users
Devs and designers build it and others use it
we are 0.1% of community that makes the decisions
Ethan Marcotte
The Wordwide Work
starts with advocacy 
this is the thing that will save the workd
next step is adoption
they do the thing too
then we get apple
third step is institutionalization
once popular enough, becomes institution unto itself
separate from users
applies to everything
part of it is need to protect it
value of contribution goes way up
Equal animals
principle of human interaction
do what you can and give what you can
Marx is not new, he just put his name on it
OSS takes time and money and power and influence
person who is the loudest gets heard
not listened to, just heard, now shut up
just go do the work and you get control
that is privilege
issue is all large scale players want piece of the pie
early writings like cathedral and the bazaar 
tinged with destroying capitalism
flood the market with free and scarcity dies
eventually the idea of getting paid will become ludicrous
instead of that utopia
large companies get OSS devs to work for them
he worked for Lynda, part of MicroSoft
first they supported OSS
funding people to work on OSS
I built this bazaar and it looks exactly like the cathedral
rights to the name bazaar
bazaar.com
going over there, it will be fine
I built the bazaar and invited you in, stop complaining
I invested more int he bazaar, stop complaining
that is not equity
own time vs paid time
unbalanced system where money means power
no one noticed
but AMP and React happened without us noticing
concept of equity through comment is under attack
coercive capitolism
transformative social movent
OSS used to be part socialism and libertarianism.
used to be balanced
libraterians won
Stopped telling me what to do.
not about power, privledge to get to contribute and deriving worth and power from that
misyogony, white suprimisists
we have responsibility to draw lines and define this thing
we decide what is the modern ethos
in the real world OSS does wierd things
Big Tech like to blame OSS
walled in big corporate gardens built on oss
Cory Doctorow book "walkaway"
If radical open source folks took the idea and live it to extreme
OSS manifesto worked, but we went along with our lives
OSS is eroding 
why did he start governance project and get banned from WordCamps?
when you runt he world you can't just randomly run the world
need processes
New projects are doing the work
governance in Gatsby is a good example
Walkaway, part 1
every time you contribute you are answering that question
inside the ethos, once something is free and open
forking becomes a real thing
tha tis what OSS brought the table
when they get so pig forking becomes laughable means there is an issue
power and money and control and loss of the commons
forks have been introduced and people laugh
I believe this fork can stand
we don;t walk away because we believe thre is hope
but that takes work
he is walking away
no 5 for the future anymore
no more 20% working for WP
that same time working towards more a11y and

[Brooke Siem](https://twitter.com/BrookeSiem)


She is squarepace user
Feels stuck there, she made a small random choice over WP
now she lives with that decision
website hosts are not particular consequential, but this is pervasive in all our decisions
She stopped taking meds at 15
remote year experience talk at PN5
Her year abroad was bad
she swam into swarm of jellyfish
Trajectory of choice
one degree shift, tiny gap when you make it, very large in the future
