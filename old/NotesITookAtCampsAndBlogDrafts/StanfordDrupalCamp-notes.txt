Off Campus is good,
stry abroad is very healthy and helps do things you can't do on campus
Siloed from other design and reinventing the wheel every year
listened to stakeholders, really listened
what they really needed was an application management system
These groups that do off campus are not connected to a central system
each independent
had to build trust and buy in and backlog
user needs first
delivered early and often as they could
they were happy right off and on a good path
opened up more and gave more feedback
Partnership between Stanford OIA + Aten
was an agile process
They are agile, not in the buzzword sense
Agile is a communication framework
to get in alignment is the goal
the 4 values
1. individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. working software over comprehensive docs
3. client collaboration over negotiation
4. responding to change
Really though
1. Talk to each other 
2. Don't just plan it, build it!
3. Work with one another
4. Be ready to pivot
get to a product ASAP and get it in front of users
Agile sprint ceremonies: planning, standup, review, retrospective
they used to do internal retrospective, with this process is the first time they did customer facing
Agile because they worked on it, found what worked for them
the platform they built: 
browsing opportunities was key goal
immediately find what they are looking for
Drupal makes it easy to define a content type
CTA up and to the right makes it easy to find and draw more people to apply
Applying for opportunities
had to have a review and approval process
pull in other student info, like records and GPA, etc
MAIS data
made checklists page
Steps change often
people can give feedback on each step
Results, 2,200 applications in year one
they think it is better than last year, but that data is not available
increased engagement, 
over 30 units using this for in country and international opportunites
even more collaboration

[If it Ainâ€™t Broke: How to tell if your website needs a full rebuild or a focused fix](https://drupalcamp.stanford.edu/if-it-ain-t-broke-how-tell-if-your-website-needs-full-rebuild-or-focused-fix)

Only 3 main points
You have to have a website
Your website has other costs than time and money
Opportunity costs
switching costs
reality: tech moves very fast
apple watch example
What does that mean?
Responsive
mobile optimized
fast load times
mobile fundamentally different than the desktop
Google loves good content laid out well
when is it a good time for a focused fix vs rebuild
they offer help at Kanopi to plot best path forward
POP Quiz!
Do you clearly understand your audience and their decision making journey
1, 2 ,3, 4?
How hard is there to make decisions in your org?
Any pressing events, deadlines that require this refreshed site?
so you currently have capacity for a rebuild (funds, staff time, opportunity costs?
how old is your website technology?
Is your site responsive?
Add up the score
Low: rebuild
Mid range: need more data
High: focused fix time
Reality - smart strategy & strong technical foundation leads to optimal website health
Swoop and Poop - done all the work, then Sr. Team member is not involved, but comes in and poops on the whole process, then leave.
need to have SMART goals
website should help achieve your mission
helps get stakeholders on the same page
How optimal is your user experience?  
Do your homework! 
analytics, heat maps, surveys, interviews, user testing
take the time to do it right
Also need to have a need for speed

[resist: Open Source, Open Data, and the Government](https://drupalcamp.stanford.edu/resist-open-source-open-data-and-government)
[Jordon Koplowicz](https://twitter.com/koplowicznsons)

Vital Signs
12 different agencies
bay area metro
taking all the data an presenting as visualization
was easy to convence them to be open
Open Source Government
been done for a long time, but adoption never been better
whitehouse.gov is something we brag about for opensource
many, many government agencies and divisions and universities using it
sfgov.org, many agencies within the cities and counties
central department of technologies does point to open source
UC system using starter kit all OSS, Drupal
DATA
government open data
data.gov
datasf.org
standford open data: SNAP, Opendata, EarthWorks, Open Policing
Socrata
seedme.org
How does this help resist?
open data means the truth is still out there
we can still make our own conclusions empower citizens
give people the power to play with data
OSS: we are stronger together
also contributing back
whitehouse petition platform
18f: US Web Design standards on github
Vital Signs: Tableau Public module
SF using drupal themes DAHLIA and SFCOIT
What do I do now
1 Use OSS - larger user base helps
2 Contribute back - share a fork
revolves arouns how you are giving people permission to use your IP
3 Use open data - be vocal about it.  Only way to communicate is to let people know you are using it.  Very rewarding to the people workng on this
4 Publish your data - publish or perish is still a problem but there are solutions
