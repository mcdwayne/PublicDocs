[Dos and Don'ts of Data Visualization for the Web](https://drupalcamp.stanford.edu/session/dos-and-donts-data-visualization-web)
[deirdremoore]()

Dos and don'ts
Why?
present Complex information
if they are not visually presented
Anscombe's Quartet
as raw data no real patterns
statistical analysis shows similarities
but when chart/map it, becomes obvious
patterns emerge in new ways
import, tidy, (transform, visualize, model) -> communicate
import ->TIDY (where you spend the most time)
Data Dos
Clean
Complete
Current
Do make a title
put the point in the title
example of figurative map
pie charts
you don't have a pie except for dessert
can't tell what is what most of the time
do you use binary data? - good pie graph
Don't distort the data with visualization
3d rarely helps
Bar Chart is the workhorse of charts
Avoid abbreviations when you can
Do you start your axis at zero
must for bar charts
Do/Don't
Cut the Y-Axis
truncate on small movements and important
Small Multiples is good for outliers
stacked bar in small multiples good
pictograms
good for whole numbers but don;t overuse this one
Chart Resource Demo
Visual Vocabulary from financial times website
Data-to-viz.com
story data visualization
caveats
On Fonts
legibility is the goal
avoid fancy fonts
horizontal text when possible
testers with low vision
Data viz on the web
how?
an image with your viz
potential for user engagements
Accessibility 
content must be
perceivable
operable
understandable
Robust
Do use Alt-Text!
be conside
don't say it's an image
link to machine readable file of the data
end with a full stop
Do Research color
color blindness colors
do use whitespace
interaction acceleration techniques
maps demo
mousing on to small dots
do tests for a11y
Test with screen reader
person with low-vision tester
viz interactivity responds to voice commands
run high contrast
use emulators
Make viz responsive
no control 
Do/Don't
Mobile First?
use analytics 
what are people using
statcounter 
mobile then desktop and tablet smaller
Flexbox
the it puts it in a grid
Do you use interactivity?
massive benefits
Animations to draw eyes to data
different visuals draw eye
awesome examples of animation
Do you need it? 
in some situations are mandatory
it's like chili sauce
if too much it is all people remember, but a little goes a long way
do use it sparingly
use CSS for transitions instead of JS or API
Audit a DV Class
there are 43 results in the Stanford course catalog for 'data visualization'
Library has pragmatic workshops if you are on campus
Community!
you have a lot of knowledgeable colleagues, connect and learn together
Visualizing out of the box
Necklace from england, air quality over time
bracelet temp in australia and rain
kitting to show commute
knitting in city council
physical bar charts
buttons
spark conversations
playdoh - #DayDohViz
How to cook a turkey
UN says data viz is needed for a sustainable future

[Modernizing the Editorial Experience of a Flagship Campus Site](https://drupalcamp.stanford.edu/session/modernizing-editorial-experience-flagship-campus-site)
[Eric Guerin]()
[Jayson Jaynes](https://twitter.com/jaysonjaynes)

Looking in the mirror
what works, what does not?
rising to the top
hidden in plain view
look at ME!
UCSF has awesome photos, but were not leveraging enough
Dude, where's my site
servicenow as defacto point of origin
APO feed to update a-z list
Drush to make thum.io api integration - full screenshots of your site
moved to websites.ucfs.edu
search and filter easily
being classy on a budget
design to the rescue
hired HUGE inc to help
content creators know best
editors wanted flexible layouts and easier media handling
Tear down the wall
24 content types to 9
increased taxonomy a bit for better data management
using the round in that square peg
use what you want, when you want it, and maki it up when you can't
Liberal media, not fake news
26,000 media files, needed better search
title search
classification taxonomies
more demo
adding in columns to give editor more control
Media important because many editors and so many high density images caused page weight to go crazy
inserting full size images
extensible now
the editors faught it at first and then a lot of education later, they got it
Reduce and Reuse
out of box vs custom code
Wanted D8 since d7 retirement coming
upgrade to newest version of Drupal
wanted to simplify
7 root had 31 custom UCSF moduels
306 contrib and custom moduels on top
15 preprocessors
but easier than you think to move to 8
config management was way easier!
building at a lightning pace
made use of Media in Core
by relying on Twig templates, cut the need for custom hooks
but still difficult to learn, weird syntaxes, dealing with render arrays was a challenge
Responsive image sets to reduce bandwidth and lazy loading
Old site
275contrib modules
31 custom moodules
15 theme hooks
D8
144 contrib
10 Custom modules
10 theme hooks (much simpler too)
2 shakes and a sensible meal
out of box to the rescucue with a little custom help
reducing complexity and relying on core
made the site earier to maintain
reduced the marrier to entry
less code, less load!
old site, used Nodequeues a lot
wanted remove as much from DB as possible into display layer
panels, views, Nodequeues
much faster
themes are more semantic
alt-text is easier to access and enter
webforms can provide inline error messages
errors
d7 - 44
d8 - 6
warnings 
42
26
Contrast issues
13
4
lazy loading really helped with speed
responisve
caching really helped
can reduce JS dependencies
refactor and reduce font sets
CDN images
Optimize views queries

Refugees have bad experiences
many die
Rights 
human rights
in a backpack, wherever you go
in practice, people are discriminated against

Share Item - selected items related to a specific Share
Form Controllers
Authentication for anon users
Custom access control handler: anon can view private files
Mailer
Demo shared backpack
Language?
Out of the box D8 Core made it possible
English first, then into Arabic and now Spanish
right to left switching of stylesheets
Process
Phases/Iterations
Sprints
Consultancy Scrum - learned that at a Stanford DrupalCamp
clear SoW
User stories from empowered product owners
dedicated Ps
Sprints
Automated testing
Docksal local dev
Pantheon hosting!
People
ID where client flexibility exists
Empowered Product Owner
Open communication between developers
Realistic evaluation of team member velocity

[Google Analytics 201](https://drupalcamp.stanford.edu/session/google-analytics-201)
[Andrew_Mallis](https://twitter.com/andrew_mallis)

Remembering how he got here
to Stanford
and how we got here as a community
is important to seeing the future
I am not your Guru
he learned it all from Vadim
--distracted--
Driving change through data
Why do people want a website
to do a thing, download a thing, get info, buy a thing
Users, Sessions and Pageviews
Person
trip to a mall
store
user
session
pageview
Session
GA has no idea how long they are on your website from the last page
session duration is strange
user intent is hard
Goals help measure campaign success
Solutions gallery
Bounce rate
excluded from other time based metrics
Master view and filter view of same page

[Plan for Drupal 7/8 End of Life Now Before it's too Late](https://drupalcamp.stanford.edu/session/plan-drupal-78-end-life-now-its-too-late)
[Dan Harris](https://twitter.com/webdrips)

Drupal 9 in coming, it is like the winter but it is not going to suck
D9 timeframe
just D8 without deprecated code
Your D8 experience might be messy depending when built
CKEditor in 8.7 is so much better than it used to be
layout builder is amazing
Layout builder is the single biggest leap he has seen
Dreis demo from DrupalCon of Umami
JSON:API for decoupled/Headless
in core
Drupal Workspaces
editing workflow, staging built in
workflows module multilingual is awesome!

[Six of One, Half-Dozen of the Other: Metrics for Your Devs and Ops](https://drupalcamp.stanford.edu/session/six-one-half-dozen-other-metrics-your-devs-and-ops)
[John Bickar](https://www.drupal.org/u/john-bickar)


Pictures of dogs!
he manages Stanford site platform 2000 sites
responsible for the health of the service
that echoed louder
Service metrics, fitbit example
maps the why and how of how to measure things
map to business objectives
how we know we are being successful
what he cares about
* Security
* stable
* performant
* scaleability
* reach
* a11y
* Business Continuity
Service metrics
tracking week over week to see better or worse
metric month over month
target vs goal
uptime example
Security
* Drupal security updates (quantity) (out of their control, but important)
* Drupal security updates (time to mitigate or patch) 
	last patch was 3.5 hours total for system
* SSL Labs Reports (quality, but cost benefit to improve? Is it worth it?)
Stability 
* statuscake checks every 5 minutes for uptime
99.90% is good enough, not critical services
cost/benefits?
costs go up for every 9
Speed
* StatusCake again
Scalability and business continuity
no direct way
one example, moving from on prem to the cloud
99% there now
Reach
tracks how many personal sites
and number of group/dept sites on ACSF
growth per month
3.3%
2.6%
Ally
AMP 
still an area to improve
a team of 17 people, what they all do?
5 devs
2 site builders
5 or 4 UX people
a Customer expereince 
Director
number of PMs
