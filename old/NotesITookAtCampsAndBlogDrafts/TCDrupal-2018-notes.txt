[Drupal and the Music Industry: Learning from Our Success](https://2018.tcdrupal.org/session/drupal-and-music-industry-learning-our-success)
[Matthew Tift](https://twitter.com/matthewtift)

A way to connect live coding and the music industry

Who sponsors Drupal?
You can now acknowledge who paid for you to do that piece of research and development
not a technical session
how the Drupal community has successfully found a niche in music industry
Dreis published 27 posts that talk about musical acts using Drupal
not the 'official truth record' but a trail that shows how Drupal was adopted
MTV using Drupal in 2006, 4.3
real developmental period with a lto fo contracts
Many other music sites Dreis did not blog about though...
before that, let's talk about D.O redesign
for 3 personas
for Marketers
non-profit, Healthcare, Higher Ed, Media and Publishing, Government
Here is where Drupal is successful
used Wappalyzer to who what sites are Drupal
so many sites are Drupal, overwhelming
tom petty, cardi B
labels use Drupal, Atlantic, Nonesuch, RHINO, Warner Music, many others
Also, Music Schools
SO many higer ed 
Berklee school of music, ASU, etc
Associations
NAMM, MTV, Classical-music.com
MuseScore
Good for business
you can drop names on clients
you can use it without caring that much about the underlying philosophy
lot of business value we can point to via this success
also Cause and Effect
Standardization - across so many brands, one solid foundation
Cooperation and working together is throughout all this
Sony + Drupal - sponsoring multilingual work in D6
not just building the functionality for themselves, share with the world
not just that people are doing this, but a sense of sharing
this marked a move to the 'serious developer' out of the hobby category back in 2009
Sony Lessons
Engage with the community, makes it all better
Working with Drupal core, not against it (don't hack core)
Fix Core too
Developers like to get to do it right
Went through the commits to see who else has pitched in
Universal music was only other one - environment_libraries from 2015
something special about the Sony case then
Hmmmm
Music is content and we do content management
Most of the web does not need the complexity
audio on the web, internationalization
not everyone has a lot of content, maybe don;t need as much CMS
Dries pushes this idea
'Ambitious Digital Experiences'
on the front of D.O
there is a whole other level going on with this 
a lot of people listen to music and have special relationship with it
many people in Drupal also musicians
Jeff Robins of Lullabot was in 'Orbit'
A sense of Belonging
Musicking by Christopher Small
we like process of creating and there is something about music that makes it a good fit
Our community likes to get together and there is a lot of music sometimes
Drupal songs!
Robin Hood
taking money from the 'big evil corporations' and using it to share code with the community
public good
money to give things away

[Progressive Decoupling: A case study with PRI](https://2018.tcdrupal.org/session/progressive-decoupling-case-study-pri)
[Brandon Hundt](https://twitter.com/brandonhundt2?lang=en)

50 -60 RSS feeds built into views
needed a custom platform
Rest API was decided
project did not go well
4Kitchens helped them figure out custom was not the way to go
needed a Viable platform
New Paths Forward
Decoupled D7 was the path after all things considered
What they did
started with the home page for decoupling
RESTFul API - had to develop this for them
Restful module, JSON compliant APIs
read points and CRUD endpoints
robust front end
React to make a component library for UX
using Storybook
it became the favorite tool for whole team on project
live storybook
bit.ly/priStoryBook ~ bit.ly/priReactLessons
Next JS Frontend
1.0 launched in April of 2018
some advantages but also challenges
pros: It works! The goal was met that it functioned
40% faster overall
In part thanks to the edge cache from @getpantheon
Mitigated risk
no migration!  this is big, limited budgets meant this was too time consuming
used what they had, saved a lot of work
also set them up for migrating to D8 at some point
Modern framework - a dev said "I really enjoyed working on this stack"
that is a super positive!
stakeholders where satisfied
Not all wine and roses
increased support burden on a small team
time is $$$ and cost is a real challenge
initial thought was he would have plenty of time to rebuild the site year to year
Prioritization is a challenge
not really managing users at all,
traffic is mostly not logged into anything, over 90%
can you tell from React if logged in?  
not really, but can get to it if they go down that path
different direction on that now, in the works

[THE NEXT BIG THING AND WHY SHOULD I CARE?](https://2018.tcdrupal.org/session/next-big-thing-and-why-should-i-care)
[Dan Moriarty](https://twitter.com/minneapolisdan)


Missed intro
CSS grids vs Flexbox
only have so much mental capacity or time
Skeptic vs Cynic
Skepticism is good in general, asks questions
Gartner Hype Cyle
predicing the future based on trends
1. Voice Search
smart speakers
does not have one yet
why care? 
Smartphones
20-25% all searches by voice
location based search
more and more popular
Comscore thinks 50% of all search will be made by voice by 2020
What should I be doing
Have online content you can search (duh!)
Plain spoken, natural language, understand how search is differnt with voice
Easy to understand
FAQ
His call: Learn it now!
2. VR and AR
what do we mean by VR?
360 videos
VR 
AR
360 video, VRML was predecessor, for house tours
no special devices needed
low bar of entry
no interactivity
VR and Web VR
Traditional VR using devices for an immersive experience
Occulus Rift, Cardboard, etc
leaving the real worlds to work within VR
WebVR is experiencing VR within a web browser, as a progressive enhancement
Only on special versions of borwsers like Firefox Nightly
webvr.directory 
Augmented Reality
overlaying real world in your device view
Brining virtual objects into the real
Apps like Ikea PLace and Pokemon Go
Apple AR kits
Google called 2018 the year of AR
My call: Dabble, still 2-3 years out from hitting web designers
AI - what does that even mean?
pattern recognition on a large scale
machine learning algorithms
machine learning
predictive algorithms
speech and image recognition
chat bots
impact to the web?  some
tools to enhance you content
Tools to help users
tools to improve UX
Tools to increase engagement
Tools to improve efficiency
to replace your job
grid.io uiKit
What to know
Be informed about the tools exist
Use tools like Google AI.API to contruct tasks
My call, Dabble, 3-4 years out from real tools
4. Chatbots
logic trees based on user input
guide for searcihng/sorting
initial interface for easy to answer questions
NLP to understand requessts
landbot.io, as an example of a chatbot AS a website UI and a service that builds chatbots
why?
Users spend more time in messenger apps, less in social media
want instant info, just by asking a bot
Delivering info to the user
How to use them
Slack, FB, other applications 
Create your own
Landbot
his call: Dabble now!
5. Blockchain
shared data and resources
can I use it?  
used in crypto currency
could be used in financial transaction, big ticket items
His call: ignore for a few more years
6. AMP
Accelerated mobile Pages
publish mobile optimized content making loads fast
Cched by google
AMP module from Lullabot
Should be be using it?
On article heavy content, easy to implement
Google promoting loading webpages inside email
not for dynamically hanging data
does it create a walled garden??
De we need instant loading
His call: could know and now
Progressive Web Aps
PWA, alternative to native apps
using HTML and JS 
Dynamic like an app
Data can be stored offline for phone or tablet
pwa.rocks
Should tou learn?
8. GDPR - Geeneral Data Protection Regulation
sets rules on how companies can use your data
site visitor may be from abroad
His call: do it now!
Feel good about yourself if you don't know everything.
It's OK to not know everything!

[Drupal 8 Migrate: It's not rocket science...](https://2018.tcdrupal.org/session/drupal-8-migrate-its-not-rocket-science)
[Jack Franks](https://2018.tcdrupal.org/users/franksj)

But we are playing with a lot of rocket data
Not coving D6-D7
Not talking about D8migrate and d7 Migrate
Not Multi language imports 
How does this Migration thing work anyhow?
Source -> process -> destination
for the most of our use cases we mean Drupal
can also mean out of D as well
What does it look like?
1. Start with Source plugin, where data comes from
2. Results of source are converted and mapped to your destination with Process plugins.  
3. Destination determines where it ends up
This sounds grat, how do we do it?
Migrate is in core, but you need some other things too
Migrate_plus
Migrate_tools
Something that makes stuff way easier
Migrate_devel - print source and map
config_update - 
how do we do it?
Create a moduel. (just a .info.yml file or Drupal gm in concole
Create a config/install dir
Ass a config file
...
run it
Testing is tricky
code is at tiny.cc/d8migrate
Helper module
demo
Let's dissect a source plugin 
sources
screenshots and demo code
process plugins
using lando locally to debug, pretty cool
ton of plugin ids
see if data is what it is supposed to be format
then process and return it
simple, most of them only do one thing
PDF parser example
live demo time
custom destination plugin
demo
every file in every directory of the system
sites/default/files
export.csv
now to the NASA data
rovers on Mars
machine crash...oh no!
restart
demo keeps going
pulling data from NASA API

[Antaeus At Work; Human Centrism in Experience Design](https://2018.tcdrupal.org/session/antaeus-work-human-centrism-experience-design)
[Christopher Stephan](https://twitter.com/christephan)

Antaeus at work
got to do the work
imagine a hammer, everything needs hits
but need to figure out how to specifically do with it
what do we know about Antaeus?
not much
Antaeus was a child of gods, Giant in greek mythology
used to challenge people to wrestling 
as long as his feet were on ground, invincible
Hercules liften him and beat him
His power was connection
HUman centrism
humans
the approach we take and solutions we arrive at are based on...
serving needs
deep empathy
Building that ase is work
needs have to be determined
The needs you serve have to be determined
You can get business values, but not the list that reflects the needs of the populations served
You don't build empathy secondhand, must be direct working relationship
feedback won't come looking for you, well bad does sometimes, good does not
We do research to find needs
We do work in person to build empathy
SO that means
You have to get up close and personal with the people you are trying to help
you have to forget about what you want and hear what they want
Terry Pratchett's 'first sight'
You'll need a foundations understanding of the pressures and motivations in play
Iteration is key
Need to share work and accept it's problems as fuel for improvements
That every change you make, opens the door to new potential improvements or issues
tech is constant change, always new was to fall behind
The needs and expectations of the people you serve is itself a moving target
Needs of the same person at 10:00am are not the same at 3:00pm
or first of month vs end of month
but it is worth it
innovation comes from observation and recognition of emergent needs
You will find opportunities to serve your users instead of someone else's
but let's be cautious on Best Practice, that normally means borrowing someone else's solution
no idea how they were formed for the most part or what issue they were originally trying to solve
Human centrism only works when we make contact with, and learn from, those we want to serve
so why Antaeus anyhow?
when was he strong and when was he weak?
What does this imply about human centrism Experience Design
What happened when le lost touch, he got squished
so will we
so?
Probable Benefit Density Chart
He made it up
y=operating expertise | x=constituents contact
experts
novices
none-> consistent
quadrants Satisfying
Innovation
Experimentation
Bootstrapping
anyone can do usability testing
decent usability testing just means plunking someone down and watching what they do with the thing you built
the more consistent you make the contact, the more yor expertise grows
the more adept at applying methods AND analyzing results, the more value you get
avoid predictive questioning "will you..."
"future me is an unreliable bastard"
Like Anteaus hman centrism relies on contact
never one and done
there is no merit badge, or cert for this
finite shelf life on anything you learn
true iteration means a loop of articulation and testing
prototype just gets a conversation and data, can be a single sktch or a full fleshed out dummy site
The moment you lose touch, you are not Human Centric
this weems like a lot of change
and there is ALWAYS a reason not to engage
timeline too tight
Budget is too small
no access to right people
Changing course is not an option
what happens when we don't engage
disconnecting is a stakeholder saying you can't
If you care about experience, you have to stay in touch.
What an I do now and without a budget?
Gather a pool of users, to give feedback or participate in research when needs arise
your intentions and their intentions don't align, but you can get them in alignment
review ticket queues, analyze it!
look for recurring issues and requests
then you can understand the enduring issues in the system
start planning to conduct research and testing as basic components of every new feature and build
make time, appropriate funds, gather resources
just start engaging with Drupal users and do not stop...EVER!
investing in contact will get us there
Iterative trigger theory
internal iterative trigger
contextual iterative trigger - you and the stakeholders and other devs, etc
external trigger - outside your team completely but cares about the ting you are trying to enable
we already do this with code quite often, this is a further step to the outside

[Rediscover Google AMP: Learn to integrate AMP with your Drupal project](https://2018.tcdrupal.org/session/rediscover-google-amp-learn-integrate-amp-your-drupal-project)
[Jason Want](https://twitter.com/jasonawant)

Icebreaker, literally a pic
asks us some questions around news
AMP
we are not using apps anymore really
install, use it once and then back to normal
FB, Chrome, Amazon, ect
using mobile for browsing
increase in retail on mobile more and more
pre-2016 - Fliboard
Apple news with iOS9
2015 AMP annuonced
2016 - AMP results start appearing top story of mobile search
FB supports IA in articles
AMP Preview
Apple News 2 releases with iOS10
AMP in all search results globally
WP - AMP'd up tens of millions of sites
Reddit - Bing - Ebay
SO, what is AMP?
Open SOurce Library that provides straightforward way to create web pages and email that are compelling, smooth, and load near instantaneously
AMP on Github
3 core peices
1 AMP HTML - slightly mod HTML for performnce
2 AMP JS library
-manage resource loading async
-sandbox iframes
-precalc layout of every element
-disable slow CSS selectors
3 Google AMP Cache
using HTTP2
does not serve non-valid AMP pages
straightforward way
basically header does it
AMP components incude their own JS
amp-sidebar, amp-(fill in the blank)
No External Sytlesheets or inline Element Styles
instead use inline stylesheets
max 50kb of inline style
but include <link> tag for fonts from some sources (limited)
disallowed CSS
Margin: 0
fiter: greyscale
only GPU accelerated
disallow regular markup, alternatives in component library
Forms
requires amp-form-0.1.js
uses Ajax and more involved of a setup than normal CMS forms
<amp-sidebar> 
invisible sidebar to add things to
amp carousel, specific to what it can include and individual attributes
Amp-bind
Like Angular - change elements with the state of a selector
attributes can be set with this, so ecommerce possible, ebay biggest user right now
2017 - history again
Triple Lift serving AMP ads
canonical URL
amp-install-serviceworker for PWA
enhanced analytics
Fast Fetch ads
Adwords announces AMP pages for ads
2018
Many devs don't like AMP since 'not really' open-web
moving to web packaging (open standard)
AMP email
AMP communicates AMP-based tech and web standards
AMP Consent for GDPR
amp-geo, dynamic goe-personalization - based on CDN POP location, low effort to get
Google Mobile Search includes page speed as ranking factor
roadshows
many, many resources
Drupal and AMP
D8.2 AMP Module
provides ability to enable AMP modes for content types
provides AMP formatters
GA, AdSense, DoubleClick, amp-pixel
you do not get AMP components
no sidebar
no AMP first approach
-> 8.3x
AMP is not the only way
existing solutions
component based rendering with use of my_module.libraries.yml to minimize CSS and JS assets
Responsive and optimized image assets
performance audit tools (Lighthouse)

[Steering the Open Web](https://2018.tcdrupal.org/session/steering-open-web)
[Michael Babker](https://twitter.com/mbabker)

Joomla Background, WP, all across the web space
9 years in army 
but always dabbled with HTML sites
Part of the Joomla Association Leadership Board
full time PHP, stopped doing talks for a couple years
used a phrase offhandedly - Open Source Advocate
was at Open Web Lounge at DrupalCon with WP, Joomla and Drupal there
all about OSS
top 3 CMS is 36% of web stpace
owns 78% Web Market Space
We are democratizing publishing
freedom to build!  Freedom to change.  The freedom to save
Security is a huge issue with us
lot of nuance
Automatic Updates - for the WP market, this is paramount, giving up some feature releases for this
Open Source is collaboration, not competition
Lot of security overlap between the projects
leaders and consumers talking together at Drupalcon
why it is important to keep it open and that is what he wants to discuss
Sustainability in OSS
even if OSS dies tomorrow, projects likely to keep going for a while
Sensio labs taking care of Symfony for example
can't rely on take, take, take, there must be a give back

[Personal Internet Security Basics](https://2018.tcdrupal.org/session/personal-internet-security-basics)
[Dan Ficker](https://twitter.com/deliriousguy)
da-Man.com

Not about how to make your company safe,
different talk
personal security
Security is an aspiration, not a state
encryption is your friend
What is encryption anyhow?  
Math that keeps your data private
Internet is data packets
much like mail, many computers are sent this along the way
without encryption, they can read your data
encryption is the secret code between sender and receiver
one way encryption
also known as hashing
64 character is good
process is irreversible, no way to get back to the original data
commonly used for passwords
Public Key Encryption
Private and Public key
public key can decrypt messages written with the private key
demo/slide
good to send encrypted data
when is data encrypted?
HTTPS = Encrypted
Encryption keeps data secret between your browser and web server
browsers often show a padlock next to the URL
If not using HTTPS, you are sending your password unencrypted to the server
without HTTPS, any router or compoter alond the path can see file resources you are requesting. with HTTPS, they only can see what server you are requesting data from
Email can be secure, but consider it insecure in general
HTTPS does not guarantee no one will or will not see your data, but it is a risk not to use it
Wi-Fi,
radio waves
assume unsecure
public wifi is never secure
with a password and WPA2, it is at least encrypting data between your machine and AP
Passwords
more common one is actually '123456'
Traditionally
Come up with one or a few passwords to remember 
now ee use them for everything
change occasional and a lot of just tack a number to the end
password resets, clunky
now we use hundreds of sites
sometimes banks, very secure things
some of these will get hacked and your paswords will get leaked out
Now you should probably change that same password on every site
only have a few passwords since hard to remember
Dan once had a ios app that had a site that he created a password for
that password got leaked
he got hacked, lost his netflix account to someone in Peru
got it back, not too bad
but could have been a lot worse
If you give your password to a company, they might not encrypt it
it might get hacked
https://haveibeenpwned.com/
better passwords
Random with alphabet, numbers and special characters
20+ characters long
unique for every site and service
no need to regularly change anymore
impossible to remember, good thing
passwork manager vault
you remember one password 
optionally use multiple factors as well to protect this vault of data
Laspass, free
1Password, $35 year
iCloud Keychain, included with apple devices
KeePass, OSS
plugins for major browsers
offer to save any login info you put in browser
apps for desktop too
random password generator
notes for storing other related account data
multi-factor authentication
something you know(password)
something you have (yubikey)
or
something you are (fingerprint, face, DNA)
something you have or know, easier for enemies to use
better to use 2 factor, pass + one of the others
2 step verification
something you will be able to know and have
getting a code from a message for instance
not really multiple factor, but better than single factor
phone numbers are not secure
back end of a phone system is not too secure actually
coerced customer service peple may do the wrong thing
Solutions: Don't de verification via SMS, Do it via an app on your phone
Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc allow for it
do need to deal with this on new devices
Passwords that are hard to remember
recovery questions on resets are actually a vulnerability 
Solution, create random words that can be pronounced if need be
store the questions and answers in password manager notes areas 
to some extent, you have to trust: 
your ISP
phone company
cloud service providers
Trust no one!
LastPass or 1Password, if you lose yout password to that, you are lost
encryption means you contro your destiny and security
with great power comes great responsibility
Keep those keys safe!
Backups!
have an automated backup plan for important data
backup data on-site as well as offsite
safe deposit boxes or something actually make sense here
