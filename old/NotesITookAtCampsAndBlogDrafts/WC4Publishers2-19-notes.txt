WordCamp for Publishers 2019: Warm Ohio nights and a lot of community socializing

I was born in [the BUckeye state]()PLACEHOLDEROhio and to be honest it is not a place I visit too often. There is not a lot to draw me back and living on a coast and traveling as much as I have in recent years has given me few opportunities to come back. Last time I was in the Columbus area was way back in 2016 for WordCamp Dayton, which was before this blog existed. That trip was a game changer for me as I met Josepha there, learned what a happiness engineer did and really, for the first time, saw what WordPress Community was all about.  That took me on a path of Developer Relations that saw me learning new skills almost daily.  I got to share those skills and still learn more this time around in Columbus at [WordCamp for Publishers 2019](https://2019-columbus.publishers.wordcamp.org).


## Food and Fun

### Tuesday 

The night before the event officially kicked off there was an opening reception at [Arepazo Tapas Bar Grille](https://elarepazolatingrill.com/gahanna/). Various fried appetizers and meat on toothpicks options as well as communal beer pitchers and a few gallons of margaritas.  Very proud to say that we didn't let the margaritas go to waste and everyone at the end made sure we extracted the maximum value.

Afterward, some of us had a little more refreshment and fellowship.

### Wednesday 

Arriving at the venue, I found pretty reasonable coffee and tea as well as a small fridge of sodas and LaCroix and such.  It kept us going for the morning. Lunch was a local food truck, [Nazca Peruvian Eats](https://streetfoodfinder.com/nazcaperuvianeats). Very simple, but filling for me, vegan option of rice and beans and corn and olives.  I did go back later for some plantains at the very end.  Very tasty all around.

We got back together in the evening at [Two Dollar Radio Headquarters](https://twodollarradiohq.com/) for some really nice vegan cafe food, some drinks and some board games.  I brought my new copy of [Foodtown Throwdown](http://www.argylegames.com/foodtown-throwdown) and got to introduce several people to the 'build you own food truck empire' game. The cafe in all reality though is a bar/bookstore/book publisher run by the nicest people.  For sure go and support them if you are ever in Columbus again.

### WCKaraoke

Some of us did find our way to an Irish bar to catch their Karaoke night.  We went to [Cavan Irish Pub](http://cavanirishpub.com/), home of the $2.50 well drink and $1 Jello shots.  I had no Jello as that contains gelatin which is gross. Can't find any tweets on this.  


### Thursday:

Coffee and tea and cold drinks awaited us again. This time for lunch we had fresh made pitas from the [Pitabilities food truck](https://pitabilities.com/). I had some tasty fries and a falafel sandwich. A single foodtruck did take a bit of time, so they extended the lunch period by 15 minutes.

After the last sessions were done and we went to drop our stuf off at the places we were staying, we regathered at [Wolf’s Ridge Brewing](https://www.wolfsridgebrewing.com/) for some pretty nice house made brews and I indulged in some spicy [palomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paloma_(cocktail)).  We did continue on after this but the twitter documentation is lacking so I will just leave it at that.

Friday:

After the 2 gull days of sessions, the camp continues with a half day 'mentoring' experience.  We arrived back at the venue and got the same coffee and drinks reception.  Lunch was not originally part of the plan but the organizers made it happen last minute.  I had an avocado poke bowl from Poke bowl from [Viiza](http://places.singleplatform.com/viiza-1/menu?ref=google). Others had a variety of fish or chicken in theirs. Soon after lunch I had to split, ending my social times with the WordCamp folks this time around.

[Creating a Better Editorial Experience with Gutenberg](https://2019-columbus.publishers.wordcamp.org/session/creating-a-better-editorial-experience-with-gutenberg/)
[Jon Heller](https://twitter.com/jonheller)


Raw Notes:
Stop fighting your CMS
Same issues on all platforms
been doing this for a minute
on many platforms
Drupal,
coneLobster, NetBeans, Bluefish, HotDog, 
had to know HTML to use
tough to do it in the early days
savage state
art history lesson
rough around the edges, but cobbled together what looks OK
days before CMS
table tags
wysiwyg
bad name, good idea
evolves more, 
arise of the CMS
hard to manage and hard to update
Elliot, Advanced Custom Fields
layout challenges and specific reusable fields consistently
freeform editors make it messy
data is not easily extractable
sort y price or filter is hard
ACF allows fields to be reusable
events
history of short codes and manual repeating ACF
fragmented
content vs blocks
2 solutions ACF vs WYSIWYG
not idea editor experience
around this time, other players emerge, like Squarespace
Medium
Gutenberg emerged from that
as a large scale effort with a lot of weight to it by Ma.tt
skepticism, lot of fear of messing up your website
blowing up the site concern
plugin experience classic til 2022
legacy content just keeps existing

[Beyond the Metabox: How Gutenberg Can Bring the Editorial Experience to Life](https://2019-columbus.publishers.wordcamp.org/session/beyond-the-metabox-how-gutenberg-can-bring-the-editorial-experience-to-life/)
[Kevin Fodness](https://twitter.com/kevinfodness)


Raw Notes:
Is a hotdog a sandwich?  Is an editor a sandwich?
He is in charge of Alley's JS practice
post types?
Pagebulders - universally terrible
shortcodes
Why are pagebuilders a bad idea - pic of dumpster fire
shortcodes are injectable 
17 screens on metaboxes
that is how they edit content on a site
it works
it is just parsing it visually is hard
Gutenberg to solve this
WYSIWYG but other benefits
custom blocks, 1 half of the experience
use built in whenever possible
kitchen sink post to show how it works to clients
modify based on feedback from that
image block, can add on any other fields as needed
only custom once built in or extended blocks no longer solve issue
--distraction--
a lot of the room uses customized Gutenberg blocks
extend your own custom blocks like you extend the built in blocks
feed-driven block with live preview
block call backs, 
two concerns
what editor view look like? what happens to save methods?
latest content from feed view, better editorial experience
background color, you can limit the color pallet
callout block example
something that was a short code, much easier to manage as a block
block editor in core, Gutenberg is the just the code name
posts that do or don't support content
utility post type, template licked block saved to postmeta, includes CSV data uploader
no free form content area
no content area, no Gutenberg
make a custom block that uses the meta data marry with template locking
can't move, reorder or change layout, 
PluginSidebar
register per plugin, config specific for your site
metaboxes go into the PluginSidebar
break into sections
can see conditionally loaded by post type or other attribute
because ReactJS, respond before saving
supports all fields, including custom
good candidates: SEO (Meta title, description)
Open Graph Twitter Card text and images
Display options that affect the entire page
looking ahead
where is dev going?
next version, ability to extend Document sidebar
PluginSidebar will be used for Plugins
don't be afraid of the future of Gutes
Not the Gutenpocalypse
Gutenberg Ramp

### My Session

[Making WP-CLI Your Own: Extending a command line tool for your own needs](https://2019-columbus.publishers.wordcamp.org/session/making-wp-cli-your-own-extending-a-command-line-tool-for-your-own-needs/)

I taught a workshop, really a follow up to the workshop I originally co-ran with [Daniel Bachhuber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielbachhuber/) in 2017 a WordCamp For Publishers in Denver. The first parts went really well, people followed along with the theory and when we tried extending a plugin, mostly people were able to play along and realize concepts.  However, once we started to delve into the world of Packages, which require Composer to work as expected, then the whole thing kinda turned sideways.  Still, the feedback I got from a few folks was that this was a game changer of a session and they see a lot of possibilities. I am going to count this one as a win even though it was not the best attended thing I have done.
