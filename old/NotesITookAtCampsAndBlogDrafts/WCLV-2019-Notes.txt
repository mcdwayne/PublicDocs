[Backward Compatibility is Good for WordPress, Not Mental Health](https://2019.vegas.wordcamp.org/session/backward-compatibility-is-good-for-wordpress-not-mental-health/)
[Bridget Willard](https://twitter.com/YouTooCanBeGuru)

Been in the space for a while
supportive amazing women
but people with issues
1 and 0s do what you expect
people don't
What are worthiness issues
Friend's therapist told her to work on worthiness issues
what does that even mean?
like backwards compatibility
clicked for her friend then
We talk about mental health a lot, but we need some breaking changes
Believes negative things about herself
we are way harder on ourselves than we are to our friends
why does self-talk matter
Self talk is insidious
it changes the things we choose in our lives
do we make friends easily or figure they'll hate is anyway?
Do we make self-deprecating jokes?
Do we try better jobs? Better clients?
Do we self isolate?
Are we brave in our relationships? willing to trust someone?
are we vulnerable to someone? maybe a therapist, but trust someone
Listen to Corey Miller, Don't see everything underneath
How do we make breaking changes
have to find the bugs, they are not features
Find someone to talk about it wiht
recognize the patterns in word choice
practice self awareness
journal
write: "I am" statements
what are you goot at?
What do people say about you?
Who do you want to be?
Write it down

[Lucky 7: Don’t Do Anything Until You Hear This WordPress Presentation](https://2019.vegas.wordcamp.org/session/lucky-7-dont-do-anything-until-you-hear-this-wordpress-presentation/)
[Joe A Simpson Jr](https://twitter.com/joesimpsonjr)

Luck be a widget tonight!
First visit to vegas like you getting into WP for the first time
it can be overwhelming
Today, he is our welcoming party for WP
2 years ago he got tired of driving 2 hours for a meetup
started his own
they had own WordCamp already
started about 10 years ago, inherited Headway theme blog
WP has come a long way since then
they had budget fortunately 
moves to VIP, got to go to summits
everyone helped him when he was new
issue 1
"I bought too much hosting up front.."
there are so many hosting companies
buy small and level up
considerations
what kind of traffic do you expect
are you selling products
is site speed important
will mutliple 
"Why doesn't my theme look like the demo?"
"how do I add a thing to a theme?"
page builder maybe?
"A11y makes me angry"
he got punched in his shoulder once at a meetup about a11y
be advocate for a11y
NFL colorrush example
colorblind and SEO
color should not be only way to ID content
contrast!
Awwwared wining site failes basic contrast checker
free tools from webaim
contrastratio
chrome color contrast analyszer
test tab useage and no mouse
Start with an a11y theme
"Can't I google a theme to do all this for me?"
redising his brother's website
Hymaze from somewhere on Google
unmaintainable mess
"I'm still waiting on my client to send me website content"
so many tools to help you write more efficiently
Grammerly - typo and rich text 
yoast
all-in-one-seo
"This is too basic, I want more advanced.."
make.wordpress.org
get involved
slack
look for events in your community
libraries lynda.com for free
WordPress.tv
livestreams
quick hits
security
WordFence
iThemes
two-step uthentication
Strong passwowrds
Royalty free images
avoid cowboy coding - don't work directly on your live site

[What you thought you knew about WordPress security! (With real hacked site stories)](https://2019.vegas.wordcamp.org/session/what-you-thought-you-knew-about-wordpress-security-with-real-hacked-site-stories/)
[Rob Marlbrough](https://twitter.com/downtownrob)

care about passwords
they can read table prefix, so not a good path anymore
Real total cost of a hacked webstite
Cost of a hack repair does not include
cost of reputation
shareholder distrust
GDPR lawsuites, CC protection services
Cost of wasted digital as spend FB/Insta ads
cost of wasted tv/radio/print ads
cost of email or other sign ups
cost of memberships sales
Security befoe getting to your website
Network security WAF, at the ISP level, at the data center level
Server securty at the host level
Often hear, I can't control these things" Yes you can!, you ca change webhosts
prepaid $3/m for 3 years? so what!, still worth changing hosts, one hack site could comst more than 3+ years of cheap hosting
Strong passwords
don't rely on obvious solutions
Block IP based on behaviour, nimber of failed logins, guessing usernames, looping through known URLs
2factor authentication!
lastpass
Update daily!
security patches are relased daily
hackers are alerted daily to vulnerbility
get free SSL cert for many a reason, SEO, http/2
behind a network scanning/filtering sytem
choose a web host that protects networks and servers
don't shoose a host based on affiliates only
WordFence is great, install on all sites you manage
Securi: free plugin scans site
reinstalls pugins from repo in bulk
backups can be worthless
no protection is site is deleted from their servers!
Dialy and Off Server and Tested or Worthless!
hourly or continous backup for ecommerce/membership sites
UpdraftPlus: reliable and free plugin
Jetpack and Vaultpress, Backup BUddy and many other quality plugins out there
Free services for WP website maintenance
Free can be expensive, time consuming, stress-filled
Advanced Automatic Updates plugin email alerts failures
managewp/mainwp/infiniteWP
Music lessons website hacked
redirected random visitors 1 out  of 10 or so, redirected to porn website
vulnerable cross scripting plugin
recovery: backups for 90 days - still infected
search/replace DB tables to remove injected JS, patched the plugin

[She Said, He Said: Hackers’ Guide To Coding](https://2019.vegas.wordcamp.org/session/she-said-he-said-hackers-guide-to-coding/)
[Shelby Sapusek](https://twitter.com/ShelMKE)
[Jim Raffel](https://twitter.com/raffel)

Partners for a while
why is coding or hacking necessary?
Our compnay has grown and taking on more complex 
Are we coders? If not, are we hackers?
If you have written any HTML, you are a coder
Hackers - negative connotation
Black hat
White hat
Grey Hat - looking for a payout
Programmer - compent cook
caution with coding
always back things up
staging sites
css, PHP, etc, file copies
Consider how changes will impact other parts of the site
Document all changes
safety first
work with minimal number of frameworks, (genesis)
Logo and header change example
inspector - old was firebug
customizer additional CSS
theme editor but DANGER!
what to edit and where
Tools within customizer
CSS and PHP
Custom HTML widget
Additional CSS under Customize, often underlooked
diff tool
Elementor Plugin
drag and drop editor
design pallete pro
Google Maps
Responsive Slider

[Inclusive Content Strategy](https://2019.vegas.wordcamp.org/session/inclusive-content-strategy/)
[AmyJune Hineline](https://twitter.com/volkswagenchick)

Verna Myers
diversity is being invited to the party, INclusion is being asked to dance
inclusive mean accessable
Visual needs
motor needs
auditory needs
cognitive needs
Meaningful Content
inclusion of all race, religion, contrie of origen
gnerder ID 
and all thing
Ableist language
people with a disability vs the disabled
use people centric language
never lazy, crazy, retarded
Gender Nutral
Humankind not mankind
Folks vs guys or dudes
mansplaining is not gender neutral
enter the WYSIWYG
styling is for coders and designers not content authors
WYSIWYG should be for entering content
never for styling
use style guides or stylesheets
an a11y is goal
events a11y for everyone
families, neurodiversity
people who live with disabilities
avoid acronyms
abbreviations
numeronyms (a11y, i18n)
problematic to screen readers
emoticons
screen reads can't even deal most of the time
buffer and twiteriffic can make 
use camel case

[Accidental Business Owner: Now What?](https://2019.vegas.wordcamp.org/session/accidental-business-owner-now-what/)
[Mike Demo](https://twitter.com/mpmike)

Mike was building CMS sites when his school told him no one was using
now in OSS
Epcot, spaceship earth
history of communication
like the web
democratize publishing, making the web and world better
free software as in freedom of speech
If you can dream it, you can do it (not actually Walt Disney)
used to sell timeshares
Fell in love with the community
loves the passion of the community
everyone wants to get to that next level
don't have a vision of grandure when you are getting started
3 page websites
Accidental business owners: started to learn jus for fun, then built a site for family
plugin 15K active users, can't kill it
day job as well that id getting in the way
just build without a plan
passion without a way to get there
make a plan for your clients before you start the work
goal of more sales, what does more mean?
clients hate launching websites
never selling single website contract again
"never have to make a new website again"
launching basic website with a large wishlist
goals vs wishlist, pick what is impactful
we are guessing as website designers
people think they know their clients
protect yourself and get the money you are owed
Step 1 get users
step 2 ?? 
step 3 profit
charge for every change
reprice per the reality that the client presents

[How to Outshine Your Competition in Our Exploding WordPress Market](https://2019.vegas.wordcamp.org/session/how-to-outshine-your-competition-in-our-exploding-wordpress-market/)
[Beth Livingston](https://twitter.com/BethLivingstoNC)

millions of websites, hundreds of thousands of devs for WP
lot of copetition
Clients spent a lot onf costinvetment
some of timeline
almost none on solution
compoeting on price is a losing bet
unique value prop
not a call to action
not headline: subtitle
not an explanation ot your service
not an into to your business
communicates the unique value provided to your target customers
what you do well vs what our competition does for your clients
SEO is not a unique prop
What clients care about most
cost/investment
timeline - scope creep, delays
on time and i budget
What business problem will your solution solve
clint management plan
this defines who your ideal client is
ideal client avatar
who do you want to work with?
stop penalizing the client for not understanding how websites are built
help them understand consequences for not following process
have a change budget
define process and consequences for non compliance
use incremental acceptance
set acceptance criteria up front
font on the website 
8 essential questions
--could not type fast enough here --
once you have answers to all those questions
give the clients the same list of questions to show the other guy

### My talk

[Bash is magic # No it’s not](https://2019.vegas.wordcamp.org/session/bash-is-magic-no-its-not/)

[Building Successful Client Relationships in a Digital Age](https://2019.vegas.wordcamp.org/session/building-successful-client-relationships-in-a-digital-age/)
[Jodie Riccelli](https://twitter.com/Jodie_Riccelli)

loves to learn
worked at a car wash
learned to detail cards
then upsell the customer
music promotion
myspace
she learned WP and GIMP to make artist websites
sales for a small agency in Philly
magical coming together of skills at that point
then moved to WebDev Studios
She is not everything though, 
not a great speller, not the one with all the answers
paul barnwell
My students don't know how to have a conversation
in a world of digital life is there any more important skill?
Don't multitask, be present
record calls, take notes later
video or in person
close all the things
feather triangle string
segment the room
just moving through segments, want to engage with each group
breaking down the audience to connect with her
imagine you are holding feathers and need to move the feather to back wall
Triangles are the joints
string is your head, string out the top of your head
Choose your words wisely
this is why we are the bst vs this is how we can help
problem vs challenge
pick up the phone
zoom is my friend
saying 'I don't know' is not just OK, it is essential
what measurable goal can we set
be authentic
remove qualifying word and phrases
thank you notes or cookies
principle of reciprocity
the psychology of persuasion
thank you notes increase registration
productivity rule
if task takes less than just 2 minutes, just do it now
say think you
file paper away
looking away for a minute "eye care chrome extension"
The four agreements
