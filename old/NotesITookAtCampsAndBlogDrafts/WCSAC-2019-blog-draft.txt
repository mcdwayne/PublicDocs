WordCamp Sacramento 2019: Enjoying the culture of downtown Roseville and dealing with the terrible traffic to get there

Every year I drive to one and only one event from San Francisco and that is in the drive to [River City](https://localwiki.org/sac/Sacramento). And every year I am reminded why I don't drive in the Bay area.  Leaving at 1:00pm I thought would let me beat traffic, but I didn't account for the [largest student strike for environmental rights ever put together](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/20/global-climate-strike-students-school-walkout-new-york-chicago-san-francisco/2373323001/) messing with San Francisco traffic. Long painful story short, it was 4 hours of driving to go the 106 miles from my house to the venue. Fortunately that was the worst part of the weekend as I had a fantastic time once I got there for [WordCamp Sacramento 2019](https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/).

## Food and Fun

### Friday 

Friday night the speakers, organizers and volunteers gathered at [Siino’s](http://siinosrestaurant.com/menu/) over in Lincoln, CA. Only the salad didn't contain dairy unfortunately but the drinks were comped. More importantly, it was the chance to see old friends and meet some new ones.

At some point I brought up the idea of bowling as the dinner was ending and a small group of us ended up at [AMF Rocklin Lanes](https://www.amf.com/location/amf-rocklin-lanes). This is the classic family bowling alley you can take everyone to at random on a Saturday and get a lane, play some video games and try your luck with the claw machines.  A pretty epic time where everyone got to participate!

### Saturday

In addition to the coffee and tea you would expect, there was also iced tea and 'spa water' available to combat the dry heat of the Sacramento area.  WordCamp Sacramento is well known for having an abundance of snacks at every table in sight. From Corn Nuts to Nerds and Laffy Taffy to Oreo Minis, there was no reason anyone would be in want of a snack the whole time. If there is a downside is that by the end of the say everyone has a sugar crash. If I am being completely forthcoming here though, I left the event with enough pilfered candy to last through the end of the year.

https://twitter.com/topher1kenobe/status/1175463231076175872


While I was a little let down by the lack of vegan options at the speaker dinner, the camp more than makes up for it at lunch but having food trucks that can cater to any and all dietary needs. There [is even a whole post to prep attendees on what to expect so they can plan appropriately. ](https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/2019/08/27/food-trucks-lunch-and-options/) This should be the model all camps adopt in my opinion.  Well done. 

https://twitter.com/GreenGeeks/status/1175499204216729601

Another thing that is fairly unique to this event, and that is the lack of a formal off site After Party. Instead, they have a networking reception immediately following the last session. I am always torn on this approach but I do really like the inclusiveness of it. There is no alcohol provided which is good for a number of reasons, but it makes some folks desire to go find a drink elsewhere sooner than later, but it alleviates the issue of encouraging drivers to have a drink at all.  The appetizer and dessert spread was pretty alright, with 3 types of hummus.  

#### WPVegan

Of course, dinner called us out of there sooner than later and I got a few other plant based food enthusiasts to go have a very colorful meal at the local vegan specialty shop [Zest Vegan Kitchen](https://www.zestvegankitchen.com/). There were no boozy drinks, but awesome tea and kombucha. Later in the evening some of us found our way to the downtown Roseville area but no more will be said about that here.

### Sunday

Sunday met us with more of the same beverage service. A later start to the day, where the first session was not until 11:00am, meant there was no lunch, but there was an official snack break. Of course the snacks flowed all day long on the tables as well. I am kinda glad that not all camps give so much candy to be honest. It makes WordCamp Sacramento kinda like Halloween where it is OK to have so many sweets.

## Sessions

### Opening Remarks

https://twitter.com/McDwayne/status/1175438319913586688


[eCommerce: What Do You Start With? Audience, Products, Store?](https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/ecommerce-what-do-you-start-with/)
[Chris Lema](https://twitter.com/chrislema)

I have had the pleasure of hearing and reporting on Chris's talks many times now and almost all of the talks he gives start out in the middle of a story for dramatic effect.  This one had a much more traditional agenda laid out as this was a much more methodical 'how to' with some very thorough concept explanations.  I learn something from every talk but this game me a new perspective on how online stores can be started that I had not considered before.  When this one hits WordPress.tv I can imagine it being one of his most watched bits of content.  


Raw Notes:
No right approach
most common is make product first
Historicaly Cost Plus model is what people use to
makes knowing price and costs easy to understand
THe challenge with being product-centric is that its hard to know when you are actually done
and mot people don't start their marketig until the product is done
Mexico vs Brazil cell phone story from his dad
simple tech issue, but they sccrambled to remarket to Brazil
Other challenge with product-centric is the you can end up building what is possible to build
but that may not be what people want or need
If you have a team of folks who can build stuff, it may be a perfectly fine route to take
in recent years, there has been antoher strategy
Audience-first approach
when you have an audience already established, it's easy to sell stuff to them
challenge is nothing is immediate
it takes to build an audience from scratch and there are not garauntees it wil work
Anh you have to have content marketing chops
you need to quickly evelop and it takes time
expensive and long game
if you already have a team who can create content this strategy may be the perfect way to move things forward with an audience-first approach
story of rainmaker platform 
handful of affilate sales, Chris was one of those
the money was crazy good
There is a third approach
most people don't talk about it
a Store
validation up front
Store-first
take pre-orders
collect cash up front and validate concept in one shot
challenge is if marketing copywriting isn't perfect, can seem like a rip off
nobody likes that
story of buying a video series that got cancelled, felt ripped off
best thing about a store first approach is that is can be a middle of the road approach
strategy, Resources, Risk, Benefits, Watch-out for,
product first
Development, developer, build the wrong thing, pricing and marketing, featuritis
Audience First
strategy, creative and writers
loe ROI/Cancellation, On-Launch-cash infusion, giving away everything
Store Fitst
pre-orders, Marketing, Audice Blowback, need is validated quicky,spending too much

### My Talk

[Bash Is Magic # No It’s Not](https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/bash/)

As I am winding down the year and am about to remove this talk from the repository of talks I submit everywhere, I am becoming more grateful for the opportunity I have had to learn Bash as deeply as I have. Knowing that I can literally make anything happen on my computer with a little logic in a script makes me feel like I can take on the world sometimes, especially when I feel like so many other bits are out of control. Getting to share my love of this tooling has been the best experience I have had so far as a speaker and I am so glad to everyone that has come to see this talk.  

https://twitter.com/seanedietrich/status/1175452655218348032


[Speed Networking: Meet Other WordCampers And Grow Your Network](https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/speed-networking/)

Another amazing thing that happens at this camp is the formal 'speed networking' session where we break the room into circles of no more than 10 people, then each person gets 1 minute to explain the following points:
1. Your Name.
2. Business Name.
3. Who You Serve.
4. What You Do.
5. What You Need.
Want to get good at pitching your company? This is a great way to lean to do it quickly and succinctly.  I highly recommend you try this at any event you throw in the future.  


[Getting Into Position Zero: How To Leverage Content To Rise Above The Competition](https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/getting-into-position-zero/)
[Lindsay Halsey](https://twitter.com/linds_halsey)

There are not enough lind words to say about Lindsay as a person. Also, I am having issue with compacting my praise of this talk into a few sentences. Hearing so much practical information delivered so quickly and with such conviction, earned from real world experience, is just delightful. It has made me reconsider how I deliver blogs and content overall moving ahead.  I had not considered the approach of being the featured snippet as something I could even attempt, but the SEO implications are just one of the benefits to this methodology.  I need to do some serious work but the road ahead is much clearer now. This talk alone was worth the trip to this camp.  

Raw Notes:

[Drip, Drip, Drip to Convert Website Leads to Sales](https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/drip-drip-drip-to-convert-website-leads-to-sales/)
[Amy Hall](https://twitter.com/GenuineAmyHall)

I am not in a state where I want to leverage the drip campaign yet, but I fully plan to in a future endeavor soon. Seeing her clean layout of how a proper campaign should engage the prospect or customer was very helpful in visualizing the process. It also gave me some ideas on how to think about onboarding from the client perspective instead of things I as the vendor would want you to know or do.  Providing value is challenging but is well rewarded when done correctly.  

Raw Notes:
65% of business say generating traffic and leads is the biggest challenge
Drip campaign
series of emails automatically sent over time
every subscriber starts the campaign at email #1 and progresses though the campaign
object is to keep your name in front of your readers
one of the touches needed to get some one to buy
welcome campaigns
educate customer about your product
confirm appts or reservations
onboard new clients
courses
she runs 4 to 10 email campaigns educate them
you have a captive audience in an onboarding process
96% of visitors who come to your website are not redy to buy yet
drip vs nurture campaign
sales campaign
a series of emails based on reads behaviour and automatically sent over time
each subscriber gers emails specifically created to walk them through the sales process
The object is to sell your products and services
triggers
answer their fears and apprehension
examples
abandoned shopping carts
membership renewals
reminders to use a software or a service
re-engage with customers what arn't opening or clicking on emails
Tha ability to segment emails lists and individualize email campaign messaging are the most effective personalization tactics  - ascend2, 2016
Give people what they want when they want it
use segmentation to make it useful
personalize the emails with first names or Products preferences for better conversions
Transactional emails receive 8 times as many opens compared to regular marketing emails
plan your campaign
how any emails will you send?
what will you sell?
in what order?
whats the time frame?
what are your triggers?
what will success look like?
Easy drip campaign sequence example
Mailchimp
groups and tags
group external organizationf ro your groups
pepole can pick waht groups to be in
only place subscriber can see what groups are is on subscription form
Tags
internal organizational method
you select these, subscribers never see these
activecampaign is #1 in deliverability
mailerlight is next
number 3 is constant contact
mailchimp is next in line
very small difference in deliverability
automated email messages average 70.5% higher open rates and 152% higher...

[Checking Under The Hood: Auditing Your Website For A Smooth Ride](https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/checking-under-the-hood-auditing-your-website-for-a-smooth-ride/)
[AmyJune Hineline](https://twitter.com/volkswagenchick)
[Sean Dietrich](https://twitter.com/seanedietrich)

This was a methodical talk that walked people through a thorough approach to understanding the issues of a website, from a code and a content perspective. I think a lot of folks in the room were excepting a little more 'use this plugin' and less 'look at the code' but this is how the pros do it and I am glad this talk had a mostly full room.  Also, there is no magic plugin for Accessibility, which was another focus of the session. Making sure that everyone can use your site is the goal and it is a good reminder it is a moving target that we all must do our best to hit.  

Raw Notes:
39% of people disengage if not attractive layout
39% will stop engaging if images missing or take too long to load

[The Power Of Recurring Income](https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/the-power-of-recurring-income/)
[Nathan Ingram](https://twitter.com/linds_halsey/status/1175846598674284545)

Nathan used to be a preacher and it shows up when he is fired up about a particular subject. He has this desire, really a passion, that everyone should be tapping into recurring revenue vs going after new business as the only way to feed yourself. It is downright inspiring. The analogy of Blockbuster vs Netflix model of repeat sale vs subscription really drove the whole point home to me. He even provides a free worksheet to figure out how to get on the recurring revenue train sooner than later.  A lot of value in this talk.  

Raw Notes:
-- in the room about 5 minutes late --
“Recurring revenue is the foundation of a successful freelance business” 
Is every dollar worth the same?
The more predictable the money is the more valuable it becomes
recurring is value

[Death Star Security: A Live Look At How Sites Are Hacked](https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/death-star-security/)
[Chris Teitzel](https://twitter.com/technerdteitzel)

If there is a person with more experience or authority on certain aspects of security, I would love to meet them. Chris brings a lightheartedness to a very grave subject and makes it fun to learn terrifying truths. I will admit my notes are a little sparse on this one as I was busy trying out a few of the things he suggested we try out. This is one every singe person designing any kind of system should be made to watch a few times.  There is no such thing as too much security know how.  

Raw Notes:
How the rebels blow up your deathstar
http://deathstarsecurity.com/
3 things he built there

[What Trying To Farm Taught Me About Open Source](https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/session/what-trying-to-farm-taught-me-about-open-source/)
[Vasken Hauri](https://twitter.com/vaskenhauri)

I wanted to go to this talk mostly because I was curious how he could tie mushroom farming into open source. What I left with was pure inspiration to go and tinker more and make software do what I want it do for my own needs. I also wasn't aware of the new breed of smaller family farms that ae emerging to provide open source food for us. Seriously. The Monsanto corporation has copyright and patent on much of our food to the point it is an act of punk rebellion to feed ourself without their approvals. I have neve been more inspired to support local farmers more in my life as an expression of my love of Open Source tech.  Plus Vasken gives a great history of how software went from open to closed to open again.  


Raw Notes:
Things he cant farm
tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, squash, fruit trees, kale
things he can farm: Mushrooms!
2 restaurants as customers + farmers market

smaller margins due to higher inpot costs
chemical pst and weed resistancce
infertile soild require more inputs
higher costs mean loans, debts, foreclosure
A killing season Monsanto be herbicide 
resistant weeds
dicambra resistant soybeans
a lot of farms lost crops

copyright law was very vague in early days
"you are all theives' Bill Gates to computer users
Apple vs Franklin Computer
binary code is not copywritable until this case in 1983
franklin orignally won

7-8 years of locense gold rush
a lot of people got shut out

hobbyist
Copyleft
they can't just take your code and hide it
this made Linux possible
because people could build on and contribute to code
without people yanking it away with license
since 2005, 15,600 devs have contributed to Linux
As of February 2015
80% of Linux kernal devs are paid
Microsoft 144K employees
45% are engineers
a lot fo them now do work on OSS
closed source software

by contrast
copyleft
additive contrib is guaranteed not to be exploited
enables the hobbyist to become professional again
hog farmers run it through anaerobic digester to compress methane,run trucks and tractor 
post modern farming
emphasis on high quality
smaller farms with less investments
more reliant on labor and expertiese
direct connection with consumer
more specialization
[themarketgardener.com](http://www.themarketgardener.com/)
WP if free like the original seeds
OSS jobs exist becuase eople need specialized
Jobs building core
just like farming, OSS puts the calue back in you, the creative engineer, designer, strategist, and not n the software
starting in farming or OSS
try somethings and maybe fail
succeed at something
focus on that
optionally add more things

## Wrapping Up

As I prepare to leave California for the next set of adventures elsewhere in the US, I find it fitting that WordCamp Sacramento is one of the last events I am going to do for the year. It is the closest camp I have to my own home city of SF, but it is far enough away that it feels alien every time I visit.  I have no idea what the future holds exactly but I am grateful to each and every person I got to hang out with and who has supported me emotionally along this trek. I know I am far from perfect and I do try to improve everyday. No idea if I will ever again make that drive from SF to the central valley, but if I do I will be looking forward to another WordCamp Sacramento at the end of that drive.
