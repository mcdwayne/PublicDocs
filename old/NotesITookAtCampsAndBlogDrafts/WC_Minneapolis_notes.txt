WordCamp Minneapolis: Hashtag confusion and so many familiar faces

I make no secret that Minneapolis is one of my favorite cities in the world.  In fact, other than my beloved San Francisco, it is the only place that even comes close to feeling like home anymore.  This could be from the simple midwestern pleasantness, or the left leaning co-op believing local esthetics replete with vegan options and bike lanes all around, or the fact that I know so many people here.  Likely it is a mixture of all those factors and more.  It made it very enjoyable to return to the larger of the twin cities for WordCamp Minneapolis.

Surviving a client crisis
Nathan Ingram
7 questions
Escalator analogy
We focus on the people ahead of us, forget there are poeple behind us
"here is a secret, the people ahead of you have the SAME CRISIS of confidence that you have. "
We compare reality to other's personas
put your best foot forward at events, so don't think ayone has issues
how ot escape it:
nobody knows everything
that others know and what you know might overlap
1. be realistic
2. be perceptive, everyone is good at something
3. Be Helpful We are all in this together!  Reach out to those around you on the escalator. Become a prson who is good to know. helping others builds confidence.  be humble!

[So, You Want To Sell Online?]()
Zach Stepek
@zstepek

What to sell is a hard decision
Passion or profit?
Not mutually exclusive, but mostly it is
finding customers: traditional marketing used to work, but ow need more personal touch
Email marketing has slight bit of personal touch, but not enough
SEO - good overall but not a full marketing strategy, got to stand out
PPC - used to be the gold mine, not now
video is powerful
branded experience is very good, brand voice in everything

Embracing Page Builders
Tyler Golberg
page speed is a serious drawback
BUT the convenience is the reason many poeple embrace them
ego in the way
breaks short code is all you would see
some real risks
slightly worse interface if it is faster, that is OK trade off for him
