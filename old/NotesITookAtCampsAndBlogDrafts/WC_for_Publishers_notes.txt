[Distribute All The Things: WordPress & The Era of Multiple Content Channels](https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/session/distribute-all-the-things-wordpress-the-era-of-multiple-content-channels/)
[Jake Goldman](https://twitter.com/jakemgold)

10UP Modernful stack
all engineering focused on digital publishing business success.  
Heloing the landscape succeed
Not going to dive deep on every channel
All good educational narratives start out by scaring their audience.  
Short termbusiness survival requires tou to balance reader growth with revenue per reader/engage,ent
NOT a new concept
associated press is a good example, not knowing where content goes, there is prescribed images, etc but no control on where it ends
Radio shows are similar, distribion as a concept is not new
digital is not now as well, lexisnexis, compuserve, AOL, NYT 
Web specials from early days
email subscription channels, RSS and desktop readers, WAP early mobile
also tried to represent TV model online, channels
failed
2008 - 2009 
rss, xmlRPC
JSON REST
brings us to now
Jake's two different ways to think about distribution channels
1 - Open web has turned to crap and we can do better but same thing (Evolution)
2 - A responsive screen of text and pictures is so 2016 channels, (revolution)
other axis 
top - this is a different way of doing things, but have at it devs (open)
bottom - It would be best if you let us control everything, just sned content (constrained)
complexity increases up to the right
so does opportunity
not a static chart, solutions moving and changing constantly
Most new things start upper right, but end up lower left, printing and app store the same
youtube starts open and revolutionary, but now is rather evolutionary
Alexa is interesting as is VR since these are the newest and have not been as tested yet
Where the digital CMS fits in
CMS as a content design systems, this is where Gutenberg is going
now we are in multi channel content distribution
CMS is not the center of the whole web experience
instead a hub of the multichannel strategy 
Website is just another channel now
CMS is where you create content
tomorrow is presentation layer is no longer in the CMS
Editors will be writing and collaborating in other tools, CMS will just be for organizing and storing it

[Jake Spurlock](https://twitter.com/whyisjake)
COnde Naste
Wired tech team (Wired Magazine) vanity fair, etc
jumped to Co-Pilot recently
Wired launched in 1994

Then it is was make them emagazines
high impact features
pushing into distribution channels
in 1994 Hotwired.com launched was original, not just republishing the printed mag
small images and text
14 person to 180 person office in a few years
Jeff Veen was early days
Wired invented the banner ad, went to an ATT microsite
hotwired had it first
MCI, Volvo, 1800 collect and Zima
dead ends in 1994
header in 1995, pretable
lycos bought hotwire, but wired still exists, Cande Nast buys them
eventually wired.com
wired 2005 launched
what a jump it was to CSS
2015 became responsive, 
last month completely on co-pilot
other brands they manage:
Suck.com
webmonkey
wired invented apache, or at least standardized it
DIstributeion platform - other topics
HTTPS
Amazon Affiliates  - too easy to make money from links, easy stuff
Newsletters - they make money
Adblockers

Apple news launch, was there for it
apple news takes a lot fo time developing for
high touch custom features, good relationships, but not a lot of $
advertisingSettings: {frequency:10 }
new ads look like text call outs
Ney Yorker is leading the way to next phase of things
subscription widgets in AMP
AMP coming out with STAMP, which is for stories from social media
FB instant - delivers stories and revenue
FBIA on revenu
Vanity Fair -11% GW -51% Wired +14%

[Gutenberg and Publishers (Unconference/Conversation Track)](https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/session/unconferenceconversation-track-2/)
[Aaron Jorbin](https://twitter.com/aaronjorbin)
Roundtable discussion
scarymommy.com

What are the needs of the publishing community
WP is the base we build on, not the product on the end

challenges with current

Longform layouts
collaborative editing (many people agreed)
moving info into WP
allowing users to pre-publish in home/category views
who has written a post and published on site with Guttenbrg, few hands, who did it without a bug report resulting?  no one
it is early

custom part of editor
field manager using ad 10up
what is the fate of metadata mangement? big concern
5 meta boxes or more most of rume
10 meta boxes about 1/4
20 no one

custom taxonomy - most people
could there be new standards?  How you do it?
custom validation of taxonomy, no way to built in validation mecanism
couple Aaron used: taxonomy new can not be added only use from list
no pre-populated but must add one
have to select to save post

really easy to write beautiful posts in Gut and in Tiny MCE, but easy to write terrible ones as well

videos make no sense for print, so Gut will maybe make it easier to just pick up print ready content
got to move away from post body - must support HTML for backwards compatibility
storing nodes maybe as individual things
maybe JSON format for these things
which leads into what does ATOMIC news mean?
is anyone trying to store content in different way than WP does?  No hands

shortcodes reloaded

worry: post body is invisible to a parser
when querry a Doblock 
set containers in 

Gut does not look into Comments, not yet

Dream pie in the sky
select all views for possible devices
UI tab just mobile, just amp, just desktop

Vision is still being decided here,
We are taking this transcript and turning into notes to share with the team making this stuff

[Alternative Hacks: WordPress Security From the Outside Looking In](https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/session/alternative-hacks-wordpress-security-from-the-outside-looking-in/)
[Daniel Olson](https://twitter.com/emaildano)
This talk is not the 'run grab a plugin talk'
remove WP from the equation, how do we protect our web applications
why would we care?  Client responsibility
have their back
stuff happens - 
see it as a design problem, not a tech problem
sourcemaking.com
Approaching tech problems as design solutions
all around workflow
everyday tasks
lobby for the right fix not the quick fix
but compromise, got to communicate
touched on antpatterns
a few idea
Disaster plans - discuss them early and often
'total data loss' 'client failure"
"no plan" "No SLA"
If you have no plan, get one
backup efficiently, not aggressively 
'If you data is in one place, it is in no place.' - Someone
Apps sometimes store config as constants in the cosde.  This is a violation of 12 step.....
Bot traffic, put your server to work and serve 404s with NGINX, Apache, or .htaccess
no reason not to use HTTPS now
Recovery, Scale and Automation?  
Does host give you this, again config as code go JAMstack
Shifter - JAMstack
available everywhere but not just a CDN/Cache
WP in a container that powers up and down to generate static JS pages
WP plugins are not a cure-all
def still need them
learn what they actually do
can that 
Tinfoill file permissons - read docs, don;t lean on Stackoveflow
MD5 is used by default becoming standard eerywhere
hashing and MD5, try bcryotm, Scrypt

[The Care and Feeding of Open-Source-Skeptical Colleagues](https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/session/the-care-and-feeding-of-open-source-skeptical-colleagues/)
[Kevin Koehler](https://twitter.com/kev097)

We are referring to freedom not rights
Patience is key when explaining this
hard to trust things that are unusual
Already everywhere
so many projects run everything
not just for blogs!!  28% of internet

I read that it is not secure
printed in media reductively sometimes
secure as anything can be
closed platforms are security through obscurity
that is a falsehood
news stories about WP hacks make it seem less secure, press likes stories about this
bad passwords and non-updated sites are bad

WP is like the New York Yankees 
unlike the Memphis biscuits

"there is no one you can call"
not a bug it is a feature
no one, but hundreds!ease for new staff and partners
Huge ecosystem with 14 year head start
harder than it looks

newspaper analogy - investing in paper mill and forrestry, or just focus on making newspapers?

GPL!  
legal thing, can seem restrictive
4 freedoms
restricts distribution, not use
You fully own your code
WP cannot go away

analogy - unfamiliar with the software world make it hard to understand
not like printing press, build use for 15 years 
more like the Associated Press

Considerations
Security, please use 2fa
4.8.1 point release a must

Scaling, small investment with big dividend
compared to other technologies larger payoff with smaller up front
before breaking news

Use known plugins!
Reputation not just a star
code review is magic 

Success is often quiet
brag
tech is not interesting 

Contribute:
You are not as unique as you think
don't let it stop when you put it out there
You must broadcast anything you are putting out there

Everyone's code is ugly
you are your own worse critic
having code out there improves your reputation, a few issues does not damage your reputation
working in the open is kind to your colleagues

Dont sell as a tech investment
closer to a continuing education sale
WP is good

Democracy suffers from isolation of feedback bubbles
tool to help

community radio
who still listens to radio?
non-commercial radio has different rules and goals,
local and staffed
unlike bigger media, different conversation
makes a difference
99% penetration radio
widespread

A Biased Guide to Managing Bias](https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/session/lightning-talks-2/) 
[Jake Spurlock (Wired)](https://twitter.com/whyisjake)

Explicit Bias vs implicit (unconsious)
between 8 leels of company
how would that impact if 1% change per lee, 34% at top
76%  prefer people with disability
My thought ->  We suck as people, 
Performance bais gender blind interviewed 
white name = 4 to 8 years of experience
lot of impact not givent he same opportunities
men are more likeley
evaluations and peer reviews nee to explain
share and share responsibly
feel imposter syndrome more on performance attribution bias
counterace
Get groundrules, don't interupt, everyone gets a voice
acknowlege ideas
maternal bias 
79% less to be hired by PTA membership
1/2 likely be promoted
oppered $11K less on average
counteract can't make assumptions
manage parental leave
"culture fit" is actually comething to counteract
more divisity leads to better things ins tudy after study
