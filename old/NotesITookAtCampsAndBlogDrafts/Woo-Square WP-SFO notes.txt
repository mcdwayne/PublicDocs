Phil
Woo and Square, released plugin last year,
huge uptick in users using the extention 
new users and a lot of legacy square usrs pairing with online stores
wide range of users
physical stores and some that don't
Walk through the setup for Woo for Square

checkout vs inventory side
sample store, no products default
in square got a number of products

-->connect your account
and square asks you to log in
oAuth connection
Sync what needs synced, but most people sync it all as defualt
different categories are a good reason not to

Need to have a unique SKU for every item in square
square items already have one, sometimes Woo users don't which breaks this

Updates in Woo sent to square in realtime
auto sent to your account in real time, within a minute really CRON based

Checkout tab
Does not require PCI compliance on your site, nothing hits your website
for website owners can qualify self questionairre with this.  
no PCI audits needed
Authorize transactions and delay captures
Can trigger orders to capture manually

Limitation of recurring payments/purchases on woo
No plugin option for adjusting CRON, but yuo can manually
if you do, do not overlap the inventory synch with square sync, 15 minutes as fast as safe, otherwise transients can get screwy
no built in plugin 
He uses wp-cron to manage this
ease of use means making a product for simpler users, no complex settings

->Bunch of customers who are not on square in Woo, can you do that
-->typcially don't see a lot of users doing that, since multiple CC forms
->this is for POP
