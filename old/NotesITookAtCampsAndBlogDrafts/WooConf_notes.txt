Keynote 1:

[State of the Woo]()
[Todd Wilkens](https://twitter.com/toddwilkens)
Head Janitor


Celebrated our dieversity and that we all make it, since it is OSS

32.4 Million downloads globally
3 Million active installs from the WP repo

So many amazing things built on Woo

They are on track for Woo stores to do $10Billion in sales in the next year!!!!!!
Conservative estimate based on their numbers
$30Million in Woo extensions this year as well
Healthy eosystem

613 contributions in the last year from the commnity

A diverse set of users
Basically 3 key roles
1- Store Owners
2- Store Builder (the original focus of the tool)
3- Extension developers
They have different needs, but this is the best way they have made these distictions
Mostly is is small - medium businesses
This sets you up for evolution, does not happen with large systems

Cases tude from his friend that 
Sqarespace got started, but no room for flexibility or growth
it was really inflexible, he has high end craft , needs a unique experience.
WooCommerce is a fit for him to do it himself, and as evolve, a pro takes over...that is the dream
This is a typical one though, likely know such a story

But it is not just about small -med
there are multiple doing $100M+ a year ont heir sites
H-E-B case study
12th biggest private company (Forbes) grocery stores
more tha 40 stores + growing
HEB was 2 hours ahead of the FEMA convoy during the Houton floods
same ethos but at scale for whole state!
They don't just sel stuff, they do good stuff

Big news from the year was Woo 3.0
Abstractions - CRUD classes
Rest
Performance
new product gallery
new CLI
logging system
Don't want people to have to hack PHP to customize in the future
The 2.0 rollout was shakey and they admit that now, they learned their lesson though
LEarned: More reliable update/upgrade experience 
That involved Woo and Extention Devs

Committed to making upgrade and maintence exp. rock solid, 
For instance: internally they ping certain woo usrs to preview releases now
regular roll outs expected and much improved experience in the future
3.1 and 3.2 had ver few issues for a lot of feature rolls outs/improvements
1-CSV import/export in core
Extention license management in Core
Search helpers for Orgers
2- Better coupon control
Extension version checks
Search helpers for Products
Better integration with SaaS payments, shipping, an taxes  

In near future
Fster tables
new event queues to remove race conditions

Making it easier to manage store builders to manage more stores from the product side
No more subscrition keys to manage
copy/paste is not scalable, now one click
Also need to be able to share and transfer subscription, new now, improving fast
---? Woo and WordPress.com are merging affiliate programs
test extentions before you buy
Better UX for store owners

Paypal, Stripe, Square, Klarna (Northern Europe)
New automated tax service, automate for all the largest markets (US, EU, CAN, AU)
make it easier to onboard no matter where they are
Have to set up Jetpack - tryingt o make it super simple, just hit connect and JetPack just happend
Then can set payments, tax, logitics before they put their first product online!

Been investing a lot in cloud services foundation
Don't want to pull people away from the idea of self hosting but looknig at cloud more and more
Woo + Automatic can build on their strengths
they agree 2 factor auth is great why rebuild it, 
same thing with Jetpack, it is larger than Woo and learned a lot before Woo, moght as well combine forces

Constrictive feedback helps them grow!

Also revamping the mobile app for WooCommerce (!!!!) 
2018 roll out is planned
Store owner feature love
Builders can more easilt sell since it is all included!
No plans for chaging for mobile app, just part of Woo

Big changes in extensions
Not a lot rolled out in 2017
BUT a lot of devs asking for more and more
Current extention devs want more direct access to customers and more contril over products
retinking architecture
!!!Going to be opening up the marketplace for extensions! (Talk on that later)

needed to open it an change dynamics, higher payouts and more control, more open

[Why Customize?](https://needmoredesigns.com/wooconf17)
KANDACE BRIGLEB
[Kandace Brigleb](https://twitter.com/kandacerae)
Partner at Needmore

Make every room you walk in better because you are there

Small shop Needmore
Coffee brands have universal issues
she has a show for coffee folks
coffee roasters have specific needs arond design
Many people get the same beans, so it comes down to lifestyle brand
lot of that comes don to design
Must differentiate
WooCommerce helps them be flexible
Joy to be a part of this community
Looked at customized website strategy and case study
WHY???
then how
and then Who does what on these projects
Make every project you join better ebcause you are there
Not making websites just to do so
making stories that have a pull, sell things better
, more donations, ect
make it easy for poeple to uy
need to buy direct on the sites, but prduct into hands of customers is the uderlying goal
we want more than things though
experiences make us happy
in the end, the hot coffee in a cup is happier than holding beans
need to start making emotional connections with your stories
leave room for emotional connectionst o grow
not every page needs to direct drie conversion
Let people fall for your brand
Traditional Web Process - used to be good
but it does change some
still alinear process
discovery, structure, design, developer, hand off, Launch
expects milestones
billing cycle linked to this most of the time
but some decisoins later or earlier need adjustments.  Hard to rethink sometimes
Earlier assumptions about customers and needs need readjustments somemtimes

We have to empathize
To be interesting, be interested.
Try to talk to anyone along supply chain for coffee
Go do a thing yourself and see how you felt through each part of the process.

Define the issue, It's not "design a chair" its "create a way to suspend a person"
Ideate
No good idea have come from staring at a screen from other peoples work
It is only in still water that we can see
get out of your bubble
\
They make lists of 10s each day, just used to generated ideas
gets you used to throwing ideas away and letting go
why 10?  3 to 5 is too few
10 means they are expecte to throw out 1/2 of ideas
by 9 or 10 ideas get weird
create and build as you g, protoype early to get ideas out
Never a sense design was over, bill by month, not by phase!

Case study time
coffee reoassters, hand tallying as they printed labels
lot of errors, customers didn't rust the process
made them reports that told them what to do, custoemrs trusted that process, more sales

Let them 
Flavor Notes, fairly new, like wine
changed the way FourBarrels did it, beat the rest of the market.

Literary arts example, 
map was just the programs site map basically
very silos
they did an empathy step, everyone wanted less siloed

Team engagement - need better teams working togetther for custom web design
Team A Dsigner, Exec, PM, Client, Programmer
Team B Some people have experience, some don't, when the meetings are over, people linger for a while
which team innovates more: Team B says research
less structure makes for better innovations

Less a good idea to stick to traditional approaches overall they have found
Devs and Design wall is bad, does not feel good

"I don't like to be encumbered by that is possible" - designer

Everyone designs!  
Design is how it works
Anyone who influences what the design becomes is the designer
We have responsibility to speak up then
means all voinces need heard

Sometimes the simplest answers are easier to see from the outside
In the beginners mind there are many possibilities, in the experts mind there are few

Sakeone - brewer/importer
team B approach
smaller budget, but important to tell story of the brewers and their local process
excited about what akes sake so interesting
Oregon vs Japan similiarities, tells the tory modularly, very successful and simpe to design
We are ultimately judged by how successful it is, not by who came up with the idea

La Marzocco
espresso machines
the lamborgini of the espresso world
give people more ownership feeling before buying, made configuratior
press loved it gave all new press, boosted sales!

We are all made of stars
We are al designers

[How we are scaling WooCommerce Core](https://wooconf.com/schedule/)
[Kevin Killingsworth](https://twitter.com/coderkevin)

Goals
Scaling to Huge
Performance: Approapriate to scale
Extention cmpatability

CRUD objects in WooCommerce
comes from SQL 
does not just aply to relational DBs
Improves the intereface
New Release CRUD class Dec 2016 Woo2.7
go read that blog post
Data stores = data flexibility
Data Stors were his idea, but he did noe of the work
Data stores are true but not persistant
Does not know how it is stored anywhere else, just busienss logic around it

Right now, default 
data store get_post_meta in array f order objects
can implement abstraction and not break anything
CustomTabels - Lot of postmeta, how t we up performance, lot of poepl agree, custom tables!
Liquid Web just related plugin that abstracts thaat table approach
How does it scale though?
Abstractions are perminate
By the time you are doing a thing, hope to have enough money to solve the scale issue from infrastrucutre
solvable problems
more machine, more DB changes are possible then
New diagram
Custom Table Data Store
Get row call, it getpostmeta
many compbos of information

Question1  Save method, there is a data structure to it, CRUD objects, why is that work that way?

Q2 - Are cutom Tables really the future? 
CRUD int he data store 

Why is CRUD important?
All owners want to make millions but most wont
they have to pick a platform when they are tiny

Multiple Sites, Multiple Databases
DATA stores make some happy intended befefits they have found:
What if you had single place that you shipped from but have regions you sell in international
do you really want to serve all of those from a single site in the US?  US - Australian connection is hyper slow, does it make sense to do it.  Legal concerns for localization
All same US warehouse though.  Multiple sites, different currencies
Data Story that got it from inventory systems
Orders Data Store
Product Orders store
Inventory can be on anything else and just feed the objects, not the DBs

Import/Export (for free!!!!!)
iterate array and export to another store without directly manipulating the DB
How does it use processor resource
can do batch or can do this one at a time
Lot of code that needs evaluated

WooCommerce Custom Order Table - Mindsize and LiquidWeb built it
Already done, Woo does nto need to do it on their own

Woocommerce Product Tables Feature Pllugin in their Woo Core team recently
private now, public in a few more days

DEMO CODE- Pre-alpha Product Product Inventory Datastore - Kevin's project

easy to implement
Postmeta matting
CRUD beneath that

also has extra function to update post meta as well

Q3 - is there a performance impact

Q4 -hard to hear but about metadata on the CRUD itself
There are meta store on CRUD but you can push that post meta
Backwards compatibility os the trip up for some of this
how do you do this in a custom table

better than adding this step to business logic and validation
just focused on what do I kneed to do to read and save data

Flexibility to connect not just to $wpdb but to anything

Q5 - eventaully you wan to clear that out,how invalidate?
Post_Meta is the concern here.  

(If I am understanding we are basically creating an in memory data store that leads a table that reads/writes to the DB indirectly  )

[Opportunities for your plugin](https://wooconf.com/schedule/)

3Million sotres running Woo under the hood
A store running Woo runs 15 plugins
6 are specific to Woo
Lot of plugins, need to have regional flexibility
we solved these together!

Opening Woo marketplace to new developers
long tail of Woo makes up a lot of the userbase
need specilized local solutions, like FastPay in South Africa
Success is when people dev product for solving loclal issues

CASE STUDIES of things individual devs have made:

Fashion is the top use case
By default Woo includes variations

Product Type extensions make more money than anyother category
also most complex

vape supply store, hard to manage artisinal inventory
bundles for own customers
rolled that out to the rest of community 

FB and Mailchip plugin 
can think big with good partners
first new dev extention
by solving a real use case for real customer and then releasing that

CLaudio Brazil specific plugins case study

1200 ideas on Woo ideas board, real problems
types of things plugins can solve

Any extension for sale on WooComerce is discoverable through the product
Not just a proeuct but Supports and Updates
Launched to let plugin devs to support their own plugins
Connecting ot customers in Woo i their inbox and pridcut

When????

[Fostering repeat business](https://wooconf.com/schedule/)
[Cody Landefeld](https://twitter.com/codyL)

Clients get hyper focused on a single challenge
they don;t want to start from scratch
this is the victory you wan to focus on
"Little hinges swing big doors"

Part if their challenges were around staffing
accounting and sales

we need to know theur business, not a crude thing to offer more value accross the business, crude to blindly sell on
learn to sell

Slides: bit.ly/keepup2017
A move to machine learning, 
Old guard was not AI first, that changed
Rare to see 10 blue links, now mixed results is 90% of all reselts
PPC growth continues and levels off
Thanks to clickstream data, We know more about how searchers interact
Theory of why Google images are 21.80% of all web searches in may 2017
We google celebs a lot and like looking at pics and look for related things
mobile results
2% goto paid
40.9% click on organic
57.1% don't click, for any 
Desktop
2% paid 65% organic 37 no click
Google sends traffic to the long tail
See where competitors get their traffic
create multiple content channels for multiple engines
Google images drive a LOT of eccomerce
google is owning the experience, Google does not send it unless the user clicks on it
there is a way to draw the click
text in images is one way to draw in clicks for the right kind of queries
influence search suggest
call things the things they are called, not what you are competing on
KEyword matching is not a competitive advantage
on-page SEO is not longer stisfied with keyywords either
Growth Hack 
Replublishing - recreate it or a part - create much more link for brand
Published on medium 

Step 1 find two similar stores in the region
Skip chains
step 2, use a combined query for those businesss
boom, link opportunities galore

Selling Open SOurce ecCommerce to clients
50 plugins on WooCommerce

Why OSS ecommnerce matters?
May not be in the merchant's shoes
True Story: 
laptop stands, getting them to market
intimidating process: design, source materials and protypes, manufacturing, shipping, lots more
then you can finally look at marketing to consumers
yearly trips to china is common
want to have own store and sell on Amazon
3 years later, great reviews, on time delivery, all standards doing great
a few negative reviews and you cna lose your store
cautionary tale of not owning the whole of the mechanism
if interrupted then you can lose everything
Open Source vs Closed Source
Self hosting is assumed here
Freedoms of FOSS is important
Looking at the myths:
	OSS is only for small stores - nope, HEB
		there are theoretical limits of 5 orders a second - but most shops will never hit this
	Free - can't be good
		Other costs arise
	Are OSS harder to use?
		can be
	Insecure
	Just for bloggers
		misoconseptions
let's focus on strengths
	freedom!  when you own the platform, no one can remove you from it
	No data loss - stop giving away your data and not accessing it all
	Developer independence
	Usage freedom
Security - proprietary hides it 
	Quality 
	Carnegie Mellon found proprietary - 20-30 bugs for every 1000 lines of code
	Linux have 0.17 bugs per 1000 lines of code
Flexibility is massive, can change when they need to shange them
	inverts the features waned vs available things you can do, 
	anything possible, though maybe not easy, with FOSS
	Contribution - you can fix things in the codebase
Interoperability
	you cna connect anything to about anything else with APIs
	Closed you are stuck with their decisions, no flexibility again
Community - 
	Resources are massive
	we can all join in
Weaknesses - lets be real
	Setup and Configuration are not eeasy to a non tech
	optimizations must be done, not baked in out of the box
	Maintenance is actually important and you need to think about this
	Clear responsibility - closed has a clear throat to choke

[Zach Stepek](https://twitter.com/zstepek)
[]()


47% expect a < 2 second load time
57% of online shoppers (2015) abandon a page after 3 seconds
how to fix/address?
browser optimization is a great place to start
	__ Key here is many small opimizations add up to real scale and performance __
Above the fold - gain speedby just addressing that part to make it look ready quicker
images and other media - minify
