WordCamp Minneapolis 2019: Fun In The North And A Good Time At The State Fair

The last time I visited [PLACEHOLDER-NAME FOR MINNEAPOLIS](PLACEHOLDER) was way back in 2018 for [Twin Cities Drupal](PLACEHOLDER). I am a fan of this town for their progressive politics, growing vegan foodie culture and efficient public transportation.  It is on my short list of places to possibly move one day. I landed at [MSP](PLACEHOLDER) early and got to see some old friends before I attended the reason I was really there, [WordCamp Minneapolis 2019](https://2019.minneapolis.wordcamp.org/).

## Food and Fun

### Thurssday

#### Speaker Dinner

Though there was a day of training this year, which I was not part of, the event officially stated for my on Thursday evening, at the traditional Speak/Sponsor/Organizer/Volunteer dinner.  It was great to see so many folks I know and to meet some new folks as well.  We gathered at the [The Trading Floor at Fueled Collective](PLACEHOLDER), which is in the old Grain Exchange. The Trading Floor is where, at one point, they actually bought and sold grain futures in Minneapolis, which is the seat of all things agricultural for the whole region.  A beautiful building turned into a giant and bright co-working and event space.  A few of us ended up at [Tracey's Saloon](PLACEHOLDER) for a nightcap before getting ready for a .

[The Developer’s Spectrum – From Junior to Lead](https://2019.minneapolis.wordcamp.org/session/the-developers-spectrum/)
[Jeff Holland]()


The Junior
right out of bootcamp
very mallaeable
you can teach them 'your way'
they are quick learners who work extra hard
spending hours outside of work hours to learn more
pair well with senior devs
experiences are somethign they look forward to
very risk averse
have to draw them out and comfortable with 'I don't know'
Process change is difficult
first time using Git, or Jira, or communication tools
lot of questions about 'how you do things'
They identify with their code
they take it personally
need to help them to feel seperate from their code
stay blunt but explain things in code reviews, not much criticism
"Here is how you can do it" 
and tell them don't identify with your code
The Junior is fresh out of school or changing careers
Ambitious, ready to talk about new ideas
Solved something - have some sense of accomplishments
Apt to make mistakes
On;y address one solution to a problem
have to peer review with them 
Unaware of edge cases, debug errors and not know what to test for
over confident quickly once they start seeing patterns
Errors lead to imposter syndrome
How do they get better?
- They need to code
- Study and Read, but they need to read code to see how others are doing things
- Pair program
- meetups - meeting others makes you feel less isolated
How to scale?
Improve your skills
Learn new languages
Learn to context switch
Mid Level - The workhorse of your team
Very competent in their domain
industry, languages, problem sets, etc
Reliable output of work
Predictable
Shiney new ting syndrome
Reliable 
Consistant
Overconfident
Over reliance on their favorite tool
Focus on a piece of the puzzle (tunnel vision)
How Midlevel grows
- Try new things
- Mentor
- Take on Challenges
- Speak or Write!
Mid level Scale?
Personal to team level
The Senior!
Able to take on new things
Architecture over implementation
future thinking
mentor
They are patient
helpful
wise
knowledge know things
wisdom, know when to apply that knowledge
focused
intuitive
always discussion, don't huddle them together
shortcomings
The old way works fine
can over engineer for business needs
Strategize
Streamline
The Lead and the Architect
the roles at the top
Lead manages dev work and communicatio with other teams
Hels build team member's skills
insulates and advocates for the team
keep people out of meetings
make wins visible outside of the team
insulate team from problems
Lead spends less time in code
The architect manages the infrastructure
Need to juggle the industry trends with org needs
has to do it without working with all teams

[How to troubleshoot WordPress performance](https://2019.minneapolis.wordcamp.org/session/how-to-troubleshoot-wordpress-performance/)
[Carl Alexander](https://twitter.com/twigpress)

Sites and can be slow and that is terrible experience
Plugins are often the reason when we mix them
you want to use less and make sure you know how they interact
Check your code
PHP and JS code

### My Talk

[Bash is magic # No it’s not](https://2019.minneapolis.wordcamp.org/session/bash-is-magic-no-its-not/)

I love this subject. There is no higher compliment to me than to have someone come up after a talk and say "You made Bash fun and a lot less scary." Though one of me other favorite bits of feedback was from someone who uses the command line everyday saying they learned something new as well. Learning together is the heart of open source and I am so happy I get to share that learning experience with the community. 

PLACEHOLDER TWEET OF ME IF EXISTS.


[Automating Site Creation](https://2019.minneapolis.wordcamp.org/session/automating-site-creation/)
(Dan Flies](https://twitter.com/danflies)

My notes for this are short because you should just go check out the code itself. I was introduced to Dan at the speaker dinner and I could tell immediately we had the same genreal passion for tech nerdery, which I mean as the highest compliment.  People of our ilk like to tinker and find new, elegant ways to solve issues in general. His support of my talk, which was delivered right before his, was also encouraging to hear, as some of what he spoke about assumed oyu had a general understanding of Bash and how WP-CLI commands work. He is managing a lot of scale and watching a devops master explain the tips he has learned about error checking and speeding up the build process was just pure gold. If you are managing more than a handful of sites, this talk and his code might just change your life! 


Like Bash there are good reasons to use it
scale
need scripting
code at [github.com/danflies/wptoolsdanflies/wptools](https://github.com/danflies/wptools)
Using PHP to run WPClI
Bash scripts got messy quickly
but all WP-CLI run in exec()
scandir
wp theme install, doing it locally
2> DEV NULL
installing plugins like he does themes. 
if theme is alreeady active check
using exit codes from is-active 
activate and check if activated , then active plugin list
ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH
Default_settings
array[name => value]
key example in repo
adding pages managing widgets managing menus

[Alternative datastores – When CPT, Taxonomies, Options and Object Meta aren’t enough](https://2019.minneapolis.wordcamp.org/session/alternative-datastores/)
[Gary Kovar](https://2019.minneapolis.wordcamp.org/speakers/#wcorg-speaker-gary-kovar)

Ever since I saw {Felix Arntz's talk at WordCamp Portland](PLACEHOLDER) last year about the WordPress database structure, I have been more interested in talks about the subject. Most of the them are of the nature about how to work around the limitations inherent in the Post and related fields structures.  I can foresee this being a future overhaul for WordPress, where we set out to fix the structure and make it much more tuned to getting individual Gutenberg blocks in and out of individual fields in the DB. For the time being, using alternative data stores when you can seems to be the prevailing path many are focusing on.  


WP Storage
WP Stores Datain MySQL
WP has strongly Defined Models
Posts
Taxonomies/Terms
Users
Comments
Options
one table per data type
SP does not do it that way
gets ugly quick
MySQL oversimplified
custom tables/views
list with the rest of tour WP Data
no extra config from host
allow you to store your data the way you intend to use it
Elastisearch
Great for search
Super Fast Responsive ime
External Service
Eventually Consistent
can miss things in shards
Redic/Memcached
Lightning fast
May not be persistant
key value pair
Geolocation
requirements
Location CPT with lat/lng Field
Ability
query slow
make a custom table
change where it looks up certain things
Geolocation - elastisearch
GetPoint
lat/long 
Task Runner
Requirements
make the site run faster

Tsk runner redis
Add a key/value for each task
taskname plus uuid
multisite stuff
Requirement
I want to post something to 1 site in Mltisite and how it on Other Sites

[Keynote: Collaboration and Communication: Success in Community and Business](https://2019.minneapolis.wordcamp.org/session/keynote-collaboration-and-communication-success-in-community-and-business/)
[Cami Kaos](https://twitter.com/camikaos)

Cami is someone I consider an inspiration. Her no nonsense attitude toward pretty much everything I have ever dealt with her on is downright refreshing. AS a speaker she is witty and always has fantastic slides. As someone who is now working from home, as that is my office these days, I really appreciate her advice on work/life balance and just all the general tips she gave in this keynote.  For sure a great one to check out if you are working from home as part of a distributed team.

Edd of a long day keynote
not 100% serious, going to tell jokes to entertain herself
Distributed work
found herself in a scary situation
been out of the workforce for a while and was getting a divorce
made a name as a mommy blogger and podcaster
didn't want to disrupt being full time mom
wasn't sure what skills to mark
customer management and retention
built on WP
co-working space in an accelerator for startups, next dae at pub with good wifi
other main contrib. in Denver
boss was out most of the time
she became a distributed employee
part of a movement
different kind of workforce
being normalized
WP is what she does and with tech makes sense to work form anywhere
Distributed school as well
distributed work has beed around for a while actually, with mail and telephone
distributed 201
strength and weaknesses of a DW
a bunch of her co-works and friends from working from home slide
working for a distributed team on a distributed project
the good
no brick and mortar
more convenient for employees
good for opening up to larger set of the best people
underrepresented groups and diversity are enabled by 
very few people like to commute
removes the late for work part of the equation
additional me time or time for family
What about work life balance
more relaxed schedule
but have to be mindful, it is work to maintain work/life balance
The bad
most frequently
how do you know they are working if they are not at their desks all day
Communication is the way
call center productivity 13% increase when could work from home
increase was due to reduction of sick days. 
Distributed or disturbed
time zones are a real thing
not a happy thing to work with
no great answer, just kinda sucks
The Ugly!
Not bathing for days
take care yourself
happy hour zoom
get a coworking desk
dedicated work space
alternate login on your computer
if you know you need social activity, schedule it
Going to gt coffee shop
morning ritual
if he has to relocate he does it once in the day
limit context switching
Culture!
brick and mortar learn to work together
Distributed teams need to be built with intent
loss of sense of belonging is core of feeling isolated
mission statement that means something to you and building community to reflect it
Tools
IRC
78% of people she surveyed miss it
know how to have a workaround
Slack, WP, Google Docs and Zoom
In her survey other peple brought up
zendesk, helpscout
githb, basecamp, trello, telegram, twitter, instagram, FB, Mastodon, Asana, Calednly
email
All communication tools
social is important to follow along to other people's lives
Distributed companies do well
Stakeholders, clear vision of company
Also compensation
benefits, insurance, money, retirements
hopefully find something you care about working on
Resources are self explanatory
working with a communication
easier in company than a project
when there is a meeting, P2 
slack small conversation
digital breadcrumbs to get where you need
include everyone in the project, makes it more accessible in many ways
welcoming place
Passion Project
Teamwork
Better together, what can they learn from one another, projects and companies
Great ideas come from anywhere
next million $ idea
passion 
communication is key!

[Code Organization and Optimization for Blazingly Fast Rest Applications](https://2019.minneapolis.wordcamp.org/session/code-organization-and-optimization-for-blazingly-fast-rest-applications/)
[Pete Klein](https://twitter.com/pete_klein)

I ran into Pete the day before his talk and the very idea of accessing data for specific use cases intrigued me.  Ultimately, the CMS is just a fancy GUI to model and access a database, so changing how you access that data in a progressive, timesaving per cycle way makes a lot of sense.  I really appreciated how straightforward he was with the limitations of this approach and how it is not a one size fits all situation, which is a trap many less experienced devs fall into as they chase the new shiny thing. If you are optimizing front end search or any anonymous content, Short Init is definitely worth exploring as a code pattern.

[Who Needs Themes When You have Blocksets](https://2019.minneapolis.wordcamp.org/session/who-needs-themes-when-you-have-blocksets/)
[Wil Ranney](https://twitter.com/wilranney)

Having sidestepped actually using the current WordPress code editor, thanks to [Markdown and WP-CLI](PLACEHOLDER TALK ABOUT SHIPPING CONTENT), I have realized recently I am not up to speed with some of the current thinking about the direction blocks are generally headed. This talk gave a pretty compelling argument that we should be thinking about block collections as a different path to the same outcome Themes gives us today. It feels we are in an in between time, where blocks are not quite understood enough by the masses and are being imagined differently by the advanced camps.  It will be interesting to watch the story of the editor unfold over the next few releases.  

Used to use Divi
Conversation at WCUS 2017
Divi is a theme, not a plugin
how would they use Gutes
layout packs
Limits of themes: static sections
headers 
each theme in WP treats this differently
4 different design systems
working on replacing widgets with blocks, but why stop there?
another limit: proprietary code
Another issue: Global Settings
customizer a good step, but aspect ratio change is hard
Most things we use themes for can be reduced to blocks and blocksets
group of blocks arranged in a way and stored together
reusable blocks
not in the main WP menu yet
export these blocksets as JSON
"Pages are wrapped inside themes, where blocks operate inside pages"
rarely do you see theme settings for single page
Page level theming is what we want
projects always get stuck on content
we don't need a block repo, we need a blockset repo
New, better blocks
Gutes Blokcs - ultimate addons for Gutes
Stackable - gutes blocks
Page Builder Gute Blocks - coblocks
Kadence Blocks - Gutes page builder toolkit
Blocks Lab
Premium Blocks for Gutenberg
Gutes Bloks and Template Library by Otter
ACF Global blocks
Give some time to help make it better
One more case for blocksets and not just blocks
Wix, Weebly, Squarespace all have blocks
Like Divi a few dozen blocks and layouts
can't compete with the community to make it happen

[Gamify task management. Take your turn, strategize, and WIN!](https://2019.minneapolis.wordcamp.org/session/gamify-task-management-take-your-turn-strategize-and-win/)
[Justin Foell](https://twitter.com/justinfoell)

I kinda really love board games and I have been [pretty focused in my other writings](PLACEHOLDER LINKEDIN) about process management and better workflows. So, to see a talk that I would actually like to give at some point was both validating and just downright inspiring. The term 'gamification' threw me off a bit but thinking about how games have rules and patterns that are identical to project management principles feels exactly right. I need to get my hands on Kandan the board gameand that [Project Management board game](PLACEHOLDER) I discovered at NERDSummit this year.


Linux on his personal machine!
Gamify Taks Management for the win!
tasks and tickets, he uses them interchangeably
hates Candyland/Shoots And Ladders
all chance
let's talk about strategy games
Jeremy Ward Board Game enthusiast and stickler for details
complex games
some could be considered punishable
Before we start, what is the goal
we have to cooperate and communicate
Pandemic game example
Can openly trade cards
good analogy
Victory points!
feature launch or a theme redesign
product launch
full site launch
make sure the goals are clear
also we have to know the roles
Project Manager (dealer)
Production Team (Devs and Designers)
The Client (the Driver)
project manager does board setup
this is not your out to say "that is the PM job"
everyone needs to know setup and rules
game example - complex
know what the standard information is
when managing tasks, flags, statusus, labels
a meaningful view of what is going on
Can we reduce complexity?
Setup is a big part of gaming
Epics/Milestones/Sprints/Features
simple terms
an example in Jira
so customizable, can be cumbersome very quickly
if set up simply, it is one of the best solutions out there
Jura, Milestones are Epics
Theme Redesign
Customize Content
Backlog - adding tasks
potentially a long list of stuff
clever way of hiding the stuff you are not working on at the moment
try to hide the mountain of work below the fold
agile development - we will go through terms
Agaile sprints, just set amount of time, wek or 2 or a month
resonable amount of tasks completed in that time
typical gameplay on outside of the box, helps with planning
setup time not counted in there
take the tasks we want to and add to sprint
you get to set the rules of this game
might not hve sprints if just reactively doing tickets
kanban - timeboard
To Do
In Progress
Done
invented by auto industry to make sure supply/demand was efficient and manage workforce
Pro tip, game called Kanban
once set up, default screen you see
addint another status with the + button
winemaking game with seasons
planting, growing, harvesting, vinting
phase moving from one place to another
just got to be aware of what is going to make this cumbersome
Take your turn
Order or flow of ticket as it moves from person to person
have to spell out which people and which roles will be doing wich actions
software example
1. Client requests a feature
2. Project manager enters ticker into Backlog
3. Dev provides an estimate
4. Client approves budget
5. PM assigns dev based on workload(prints/ToDo)
6. Dev does work (in progress)
7. Lead dev revies work
8. Client reviews the work and it gets deployed
9. PM completes it
Castle Panic game example
Draw Cards (pick a task)
Play Cards (do the work)
Move the monsters (Hand it off)
moving the tokens are fun
Trello does this too
jira owns Trello now
Remember post-move actions
last step should be reassigning it to the next person
Do necessary documentation, tell people what you did
links, screenshots
Add/Remove label or a flag, etc
Reassign it to the next person in line
Who's turn is it?
Sometimes there is a lull cause people are masterminding a plan to win
not asking who's turn it is is bad
asking it is right thing to do when in doubt
it is important to know when it is your turn and what todo on your turn
My CLient Refuses to use our Task Management System
Coach them on the rules
Remind them that it's their project
play the game for them (when they go to the bathroom), play fair and good
Celebrate the wins
Review tasks at the end of a milestone, let each dev or designer show off work
Talk about what went well and what coule be improved (adjust the rules)
Provide a peer-to-peer reward system
peer to peer feedback better than top down
Take our turn, Strategize and WIN!

## Wrapping Up

I rarely have to say anything negative about a hotel experience but I need to get this pne off my chest.  The [Moxy Downtown Minneapolis](PLCEHOLDER) was a terrible experience for me. Thursday night going into Friday the fire alarm went off at 1:30am and due to an alarm malfunction they could not turn it off on the floor I was on. I had to change rooms at 3:00am. My new room had very thin walls and for the next 2 nights I had some noisy neighbors. This all added up to the least sleep I have gotten on a roadtrip in recent memory. It might be a hip, kitschy vibe but my stay there was the opposite of why I want to stay at a hotel.  

Other than the lack of sleep this was a fun trip. It was great to see everyone and I walked away not just learning some new cool stuff, but I also walked away excited other folks are as into process management and project management optimization as I have been recently.  As my life changes and I am recognizing my frequenting of so many WordCamps might be winding down, it makes me appreciate every second I spend out on the road to support the community even more.  I have no idea when or if I will every return to Minneapolis, but I look forward to that day. Maybe it will even be for WordCamp Minneapolis 2020.
