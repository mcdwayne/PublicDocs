## Sessions

[PHP for WordPress](https://2018.portland.wordcamp.org/session/php-for-wordpress/)
[Alena Holligan](https://twitter.com/sketchings)

sketching/wp-random
php for WP 
let's not put our code in themes
Candy she gave out
that is the value we are storing
reese's, m&ms, etc
Ben, what candy do you have? 
need to name variables to call them
more complex with arrays
M&Ms are like arrays
packets with individual pieces
it is multiple items in the item
lot of array functions 
Nesting arrays
array within an array
just like a big candy bag has multiple M&M bags
name the key is associative array, names let us call things
variables: Scalar (bool, int, float, string)
$workday = false;
$hour = 6;
$price = 15.25;
$quote = "sting"; //string
constants
define ( 'FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true); - // Contant bool that does not change
An opening and a closing in PHP (not all have closings)
<?php
/*
multi line comment
*/
$total = 6 + 3; //math
echo "display the $total"; 18.5
echo 'display the $total'; $total
var_dmp($total, FORCE_SSL_ADMIN);
// float(18.5) bool(true)
?> leave off if EOF
Make a random quote generator
$motivation = array(
"string 1"
"String 2"
);
$motivation[] = $quote;
echo $motivation[0];
//indexed array by default, numbered -- this is faster but can get complex
Alexia messes up array when counting by 10s, off by one
Functions!
way to repeat code without rewriting it
lot of pre-made functions that you should leverage
string substr
int strlen
string trim (rtrim, ltrim)
int strpos - find position of first appearance of sub string specified
strtolower - lowercase
mixed str_replace 
Array functions
array_merge
//our own functions
function sketchings_quotes -- add your namespace thing in front, sketchings is her namespace github
$motivation = array(...);
$encouragement = array(...);
if ( in_array(strowlower(trim($category)), array('motivation') 
Conditionals
if this, then that
inside her own function again
if the category is not empty
pass to category and get quotes
if hour > 4 && < 17
motivation
else
encouragement
array_rand($quotes)
echo 
Loops
things we are going to do to variables
Types of loops
for 
while
do...while
foreach ($search as $word){
$content
str_ireplace() - replace word no matter the case
...
return $content;
}
that is the basics of PHP
Plugins
writing a funciton with the above code
minimum viable plugin is one file
sketings-random-quote-playground.php
<?php 
/*
Plugin Name: wp Random Quote Playground
*/
// THAT IS ALL YOU NEED, that would run
interacting with WP
Themes - look and feeel, not how it acts
Plugins - added functionality
Hooks - Thmes and Plugins Hook into Core using Actions and Filters
Actions - add or remove functionality
Filters - Change data
First we do an action
add_action ( 'wp_head', 'sketchings-random-quote_style' );
when the wp_head is called, call this function
wp_register_style( "")
plugin_dir_url( __FILE__ ) . 'css/styles.css' 
Registered, used, where
now add in fucntion
add_filter ('the_content', 'sketchings_tooltip');
when you push your hook, WP passes some things in automatically
passes ($content) for instance gets us WP content
function sketchings_random_quote_shortcode( $atts ) {return sketchings_random_quote( $atts[category']);
}
add_shortcode(
'random-quote', 'sketchings_random_quote');
)

[Columbia Lightning Talks](https://2018.portland.wordcamp.org/session/columbia-lightning-talks/)

[How to clean up the WordPress Database](https://2018.portland.wordcamp.org/session/columbia-lightning-talks/)
[David Greenwald](https://twitter.com/davidegreenwald)
Friend had site, 100K monthly visitos
Cheap shared to VPS n fix
Cloudflare didn't work either
wpoptimize to try and clean DB
it was the DB, old plugin leaded in lot of crap
282MB Options table before
2MB after
5 users at once = 1 gig of ram
DB are sneaky, expensive, bad for business and traffic
All your WP content lives in the DB
plugins add their own table
plugin ads a ton of tables
yoast does to
woo does a lot
not bad, just need to be careful
biggest issues
Large umber of rows
large data size
how to tell if DB is slow
speed test to tell
Google says 200ms or less
def less than 500ms
high traffic increases webtimes
can be slow due to 
slow server
old PHP 5.6 and older
Slow DB
or all three
Caching is a band-aid for the DB, aalways test is caching off
most important tables for cleanup
wp_options
wp_postmeta
wp_post
wp_comments
wp_tables
DB detective tools
plugins
wysql tools
always backup your DB first
wp-optimize
can clean DB of trash
wp-Optomize is good for post and comment tables
does not solve options table
looking for bad actors, abandoned ata from old plugins
code example

[Gutenberg and WordCamp.org’s Shortcodes](https://2018.portland.wordcamp.org/session/columbia-lightning-talks/) 
[Corey McKrill](https://twitter.com/coreymckrill)

Works on WP.org
site network
how they went form shortcodes to blocks
if he can make a block, so can you
12 year old site
custom post type called speaker
"I am a post"
speaker shortcode shows name, gravatar and description
when thinking on it 3 stages
1. server side render
but this means has to reload the whole preview and UX is slow
2. native JS on the client side
had to learn more react things
every time change parameter it is really, really fast
more complex and steeper learning curve
static in the preview though, have to use sidebar controls
thinking outside the []
things you couldn't do with the shortcode system
select individual speakers
ope source, you can contribute

[Holy Blockamole: Tips On Learning Block Development](https://2018.portland.wordcamp.org/session/columbia-lightning-talks/) 
[Andrew Taylor](https://twitter.com/ataylorme)

lot to learn
start with the user experience in mind
Start with PHP
eventually you will need to write custom blocks
add theme support, much easier learning curve than writng new blocks
apply block filters
this gives guardrails
post type templates
shows the user the one and only and best way to do things
dynamic blocks
what is output on page can get saved in static blocks
when post is in an RSS or mobile, needs to be different , can't be static
render callback in PHP
don't start from scratch!  wp-cli, 
understand modern JS
been evolving for a long time
evolving faster now
lot of new ideas and concepts, big leaps
but doable
React and JSX
change the state, not the DOM
attribute for things like Location
state error messages
review the source code of Gutenberg itself
how did they build core blocks?
thorough documentation
in-depth tutorials
great code samples, they had both modern and ES5
review the goals and philosophies, before you write a line of code

[Types, Subtypes, Meta, Options – An Abstract View On Data Structures in WordPress](https://2018.portland.wordcamp.org/session/types-subtypes-meta-options-an-abstract-view-on-data-structures-in-wordpress/)
[Felix Arntz](https://twitter.com/felixarntz)



The post is not the post type
no taxonomy that is called term but terms are types
how posts and terms relate
---
slight nuances in all the APIs 
POST and Terms are very simlar in many to many relationships
why do we care about object types now?
what is metadata
tables that hold specific items
arbitrary key value pairs with realtions to the thing
can store multiple values per object
meta has an abstract API
Object types
group of entities of similar nature
API follow a common stucture
object type is not the post type

[7 Keys to Sustainable WordPress Projects, Inspired by Buildings](https://2018.portland.wordcamp.org/session/7-keys-to-sustainable-wordpress-projects-inspired-by-buildings/)
[Nick Halsey](https://twitter.com/NickHalsey_)


Loking at buildings
example 1: 30mil building getting 135mil rebuild
example 2: reduced impact and costs by reusing same frame
example 3: POstTension Contrete Flat-Slab Structures - environmental impact is pretty bad
resiliency: Washington County Public Services
thinking for the future
building codes
Zoning code
what the building can be, how much x it can have
how tall it can be
you can work around codes if better results are agreed upon and proved
WP Philosophy is like the 
He has reduced this down to:
Implementation
1. focused
2. Simplified
3. Generalized
4. Automated
Process
5, Iterative
6. Attentive
7. Open - to the 4 freedoms the GPL presents
Design Review
must meet with architect before applying Zones
peer feedback to get it ready to propose the final draft
examples in Portland
he works on theme installer in customizer
streamline the process
worked with team to get to good UX
Modular construction
precast facade
structure reusedable custom post types
he built sheet music site
explains benefits of custom post types
ties taxonomy
Retrofit/iterate
not seismically stable county building
exterior cross beam frames
worked on 14 color 4.5 color picker in customizer
little improvements like quicker previews are good way to iterate and improve over time
adaptive reuse
transforming an old boarded up factory into event space
entirely new use but keep character and history 
Annenberg Digital Lounge
shared taxonomy and could keep much out of the box WP core pieces that were in place
tool taxonomy
Balancing Disruptive Innovation
Mass-timber tower firesafe and seismically 
more innovative materials, and costlier
so on hold now
but made other projects more doable
Gutenberg is here and about to be shipped in core in 2 weeks
7 keys to sustainable WP projects:
1 building codes
2 the WP philosophy
3 Design and Code Review
4 Modular Construction
5 Retrofit/Iterate
6 Adaptive Reuse
7 Balance Disruptive innovation

[The Life and Death of a WordPress Agency](https://2018.portland.wordcamp.org/session/the-life-and-death-of-a-wordpress-agency/)
[Matthew Eppelsheimer](https://twitter.com/mattepp)

toxic job
left to dream job
project and company cancelled
sulked, then
thought, just make the agency he wants to see int he world 
this is the story
his soapbox hour
in the beginning just him
originally small family owned local businesses
They needed a simple site and contact info
then got better connections, grew client base
slowly built team
hired Matt P. 
developer
front end was next hire
people with better and different skills
burned brightly and a bit unstable for a while
if building a team around you, rolling the dice
smaller you are the harder to wether the storm
another designer
with more professional logo
people with real marketing budget
appearances absolutely matter
hired his brother for operations help
MBA
quit a couple months in
didn't like working behind machines
now in school again for medial
all hired friends and family
dont do this
complicates things
Beware firing friends
You need to be good as marketing
they were never good at marketing
Marketing Agencies eat WordPress agencies' lunch
learn to disassociate
can't take it personally
perfect enemy of good
good enough for today's needs is good enough
referrals are everything
We never got many
make website and web appps for clients
to grow capabilities and capital, to launch local food startups
Economics of Devs on the payroll
$60K is smallest amount for professional dev
The thing we did best was care about people
Repel bad actors
be daring with your values
prioritize your manager's ecellence
Center the Team, more than the individual

### Special surprise guest Q&A

[Matt Mullenweg](https://ma.tt)


"Gutenberg broke a plugin I was using, when it updates 'Is it a have to thing?'"
which plugin? Events calendar 
explained how to use classic plugin and how to adopt Gutenberg
"How is it coming back day to day"
Twitter makes people fight more
"what is the tipping point of people being on board with Gutes
getting early adoption key, want it to be non-event
Mentions Bluehost by name
changed support calls?
non-event, not really
muscle memory vs learning curve
Beta releases never get this kind of distribution
maybe 2K to 3K
Gutes has 600K, many in production
push date to 26th
backup in January part of the plan
Need more eyes, wordpress.com 
"launched 2 sites with Gutes, working on new stuff, old sites, Fun to work with.  Blocks make 
SEO! 
"A11y things growing, what up with that?"
We had some project management disconnect 
things we can do better
volunteer team should not be external from core
over 200 closed issues from the beginning
poorly in many parts that the a11y team didn't point out
Accessibility 
wholistic look
many plugins don't ever care about accessibility
as we replace widgets and shortcodes into a consistent framework
open it up to users who 
"not about Gutes, 
it is what does the future look like ina world of distrust and central authorities"
WP is not part of the dirtibution system
twitter is very polorizing
likes to talk about it on twitter
lot of good comes from these networks
technological optimist
social networks have woken up to the problem
thing are getting better with figuring out 
"Are we still going to call it Gutenberg? "
Codenames take on lifes of their own
Gutenberg is being adopted by other CMS
New WordPress
its all WP to people outside this room
just be in passing 
they kind of expect what new 
"One surprising thing you have learned that has changed his thinking around ecosystems around OSS"
Next year we will focus more on the 5 for the future 
40 full time volunteers from Automattic
reinvest back into core development
should be able to do 3-5 Gutes size projects at once
need much better Project Management
Policy that will be adopted
hundreds of volunteers
coordination should align Core's values
"Too soon to ask?  But what about React, what happens in the future JS and WP?"
REST API
Gutes is first thing built on the REST API
they found a lot of gaps along the way
APIs must be made more robust
Gutes Semantic HTML
cross CMS Gutes blocks
WP hot digity
APIs
