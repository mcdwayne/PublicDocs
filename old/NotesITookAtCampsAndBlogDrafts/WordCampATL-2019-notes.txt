Contribution Day

[Being a Model WordPress Contributor](https://2019.oc.wordcamp.org/session/being-a-model-wordpress-contributor/)
[Jonathan Desrosiers](https://twitter.com/desrosj)

2013 first contribution
simple 1 line change
props
WC Providence
helped with a change but didn't credit since didn't directly touch code
Lurking in the bushes
getting a feel for community
see people knew from Trac and Slack
went into next phase, volunteering phase
raise hands to do things
mundane things at first, meeting sumaries, accumulating research into blog posts
IE report
2017 Community Summit
honor to be there
Motivated to do more
recognized for contributions he had been doing
last year Bluehost hired him to be core contrib full time
Someone asked for him to become core contributor rights
ma.tt approved it last year
this year he is on the triage team, the lead
6,500 tickets in trac
lot of issues, some are just misplaces core requests
Wordwide
it has led to so many opportunities
so many friends from contributing to Open Source
OSS Contributions transend jobs
those contributions go with you wherever you go
What makes a great contributor?
be thorough as possible
over 1/3 of internet, can run in many combinations and code
Be patient
it takes a while sometimes
not everyone has English as first language
put yourself in other person's shoes
Always be curious
always try to learn new things
Be empathetic
again, put yourself in their shoes
Understand timing
set realistic expectations
it is not because people don't care or not important
but sometimes not in line with current project priorities
Understand the project priorities
You are not alone
there are others there even if not immediate respond
Assume good intent
people are not trying to be jerks
Master specific topics 
this is valuable for the project
you can also become a "Generalist"
He focuses on Media compnenet and multisite, but otherwise a generalist
go to make.wordpress.org
find a team
get on slack
observe, look at trac tickets and learn how things work
2nd and 4th wednesday in Core slack is a new contributor meeting
Jonathan is a moderator
Research - follow the process and see where ticket or code line was introduced
Volunteer
raise your hand to help
Good furst bugs 
lot of ticket reports for 'first bug' good way to get started
fluctuates week to week
Convince the boss that you should do this on company time
Don't be afraid to ask for help
don;t feel alone and stuck, ask for help
Details, details, details.  Be specific as possible
someone else has zero prior knowledge outside that ticket
save future research and duplicate work
Maintaining vs Contributing
Maintainers have long term stake in the project
Contributors drop in and out
not as time consuming as Maintaining
Have a Positive impact
just try to do good

WPTV serves as a way to disseminate this discussion across the glob, and as an archive of the history of the WP project
there is hardware to manage
new contributors, captioning and editing
1gig file size limit
anyone can submit to it
volunteer editors help moderate these videos
check against quality guidelines
trim videos, add intro and outro
compress as needed

[GDPR for Developers](https://2019.atlanta.wordcamp.org/session/gdpr-for-developers/)
[Andrew Norcross](https://twitter.com/norcross)

He is not a lawyer
talk to council with your company for real legal advice
The word we care about is Data
Data is worth a lot of money to a lot of people
Any information that is related to or identifies a naturally identified person
about 25 years ago
in the early days 
was all about connecting people
All companies say "trust us with your data"
that was a mistake
92% of people worry about their online privacy
31% of people understand how companies use and maintain their data
74% of people have limited their online activity int he last year due to privacy concerns
many Major brands have one thing in common
Data breaches
EU privacy and law work different
The user has rights about that site
Right to be informed if you have a data breech you must tell the people effected
right to data access
more or less on demand
in a human readable format
can't be just a raw DB dump without explanation
has to be all of it
Right to be forgotten
deleting 
quitting facebook, it never goes away
at best you are leasing data
Because 
it never belonged to you anyway
James Lang
developer from VW
in prison
was building emissions 
not the CEO, CTO or decision maker
not lead dev
not the ringleader
doing his job
building what we are asked to build is not good enough 
so what about it?
In the US we define personal data slightly different
'anything that pertains to me' in the EU
health data
political opinions
racial origina
sex life
genetic data
biometric
location data
pseudonymized data
online identifiers
why that last one?
IP address
Mobile device IDs
RFID
MAC Addresses
Cookies
user IDs
we hold all this in WP core for EVERY user
this applies to EVERYONE who does business with the EU
can avoid? maybe but no
Can't ignore the law
Data controllers
you decide what gets collected, how it used and shared
Data processors. use that darta
Privacy by design
privacy can't be bolted on later
7 point dev methodology
data intensive process
has to outline what data and who has access
part of discovery
regulators can demand on demand
Need to know everything
what comes into that site
Privacy Impact Assessment
This is still evolving
voice data was added after initial passing
not going to loophole out of this
Is this actually enforced?
They do enforce it
France fined Google $57M for not complying
not the max they could charge
individual contries can come after you
Will they really notice me?
First company every fined was over 2018 summer data breech
did every step right, letter of the law
still got fined
Ignorance is not an excuse
It matters
you want your stuff secure 
And he does not want Facebook to ever 
know mor about him than he does

[Basic Principles of Software Architecture](https://2019.atlanta.wordcamp.org/session/basic-principles-of-software-architecture/)
[Micah Wood](https://twitter.com/wpscholar)


Software dev lifecycle
Requirements
design
implementation
QA
Maintenance
But what do clients care about
Cost
Timeline
Effectiveness
will it work now and a month from now, in the future can others take care of it?
Time and costs affected be design and implementation and delivery process
design changes are cheap and easy
implementation phase, be more costly
Delivery - reworking things after delivery will take the most time and are guaranteed to cost a fortune
What makes a project effective
solves the problem
is easy to maintain
The equation of software design
D = (Vn + Vf)/ (Ei+Em)
From code simplicity
V = value
E = ease of maintaining
24% APR
technical debt can bankrupt your project
shortcuts in maintenance
Law of change
The Longer your program exists, the more likely that any part of it will have to change
Law of defect probability
The chance of introducing a defect is proportional to the size of the changes you make
Law of simplicity
The ease of maintenance is proportion ot he simplicity of it's individual pieces
goals
Easy to understand
easy to  modify
easy to test
Self-Documenting Code
Use clear naming and small, specific functions
don't get out of sync with inline comments, or the code starts lying to you
don't use vague or abbreviated variables
be clear
Limit cognitive load
Consolidate logic and create clear boundaries
Limit code reviews to less than 200 lines of code
D.R.Y
Repetition is the mother of learning
repetition is good while you are learning
"Every pieve of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative, representation within a system" pragmatic programmer
Duplication of knowledge is a violation
duplication of code is NOT a violation
Knowledge includes data, business logic, algorithms
Code is Variables, code structures and function calls
Ambitious application before there is a duplication of knowledge leads to prematre optimization
Ambitious application to code structures result in unnecessary coupling and complexity
You aint gonna need it
YAGNI
Single responsibility principle
a class or module should have one and only one reason to change
think functionality, logic and display
if coupled, changes cause issue for both
Open Closed Principle
software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
make sure easy way to extend the code
Modularity
Clear boundaries
Decoupled
Continuity
protection
must protect classes instead of all public
Extensibility
Reuse/Release principle
Only components that are released through a tracking system can be effectively used
composer is a good solution for this
or npm
wppackagist.org
A good software architect will delay decisions for as long as possible
uncle bob martin
care about the core business logic first and foremost
the actual business core
resources slide (good stuff)

[How to Control Scope Creep by Embracing Change](https://2019.atlanta.wordcamp.org/session/how-to-control-scope-creep-by-embracing-change/)
[Beth Livingston](https://twitter.com/wproadmaps)

Scope creep is the villian
She got into WP during the extreme couponing era
.net first, but that developer got a girlfriend and quit
He gave her Joomla, she then found WP
What we going to learn?
What is scope creep
How projcts creep
proof this works
how to embrace change
and the magic of the change budget
How does a WP project creep?
Lack of clarity
Beginning design and Development too early
Over promise
Gold plating
How it hapoens
at deliver "just add"
"I thought I told you"
Content late from clients
They swap out point of contact to not the subject matter expert
Common ways you create it in project
"Throwing something in because you think it is cool"
this is gold plating
"waste of money and time"
"That's a small change, I'll kist do it for free for now"
"Change control process takes too long"
"We will start before we have all the needed parts"
Embrace change management
Define the job in detail
get the right people involved
estimate the tim and cocsts
Break the Job down
Establish a change procedure
Agree on acceptance criteria
How?
Educate the client
acknowledge change as inevitable
Abandon the crystal ball approach 
Don't just guess, have measurable way to do things
Position change as opportunity
Always position as phase 2 
Establish and STICK TO a change management process
Put the client in charge of change
It is not their fault they don't know
Discuss your management plan early
Be brutally honest about change
Suggest other options for content activities
Let them know that all projects do change
Don't treat change like a penalty to the client
Positioning change as Opportunity
Phase 2 can be as big as needed
micro site for phase 1 is OK if they are in a hurry or don't have much content
Stick to your established Change Process
Putting the client in charge of change
"Pad is Bad"
You can't measure it
stop calling it a quote
it is an estimate
Elements of Good Change Control Process
Uses a change budget
Defines what contitues a change
Identifies who can intimidate a change request
Establishes that all change requests are in writing
Specifices where the CR will be maintained
ID who approve/rejest the CR
Specify how long a change approval or jection should take
Clearly sttes what happens if the client does not respond
Specifies the billling
examples of her process
issues management is a whole related thing but separate
