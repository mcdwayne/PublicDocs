## Sessions

[2019 WordCamp Asheville Keynote.](https://2019.asheville.wordcamp.org/session/keynote/)
[Chris Lema](https://twitter.com/chrislema)

Raw Notes:
Call in the middle of the night
for his dad
after dinner, had to go back to work
this was weird
couple days away
Low earth orbiting satellites
his dad worked for them telecommunication
launching in a country like Brazil
bought billboards and retails shops
meanwhile in Mexico
sat phone kicked in and 
mixed up panels on sat and covered Mexico not brazil
Can I tell you the five mistakes I'll never forget
1. The time I hired Mr. Green
He recruited a guy from Microsoft
then gives him first assignment, fell down
quick win assignments
didn't do that
then no show
sending flowers to his wife in hospital
I know what you're doing
then background checked
never worked at previous employer 
more data, 
Lesson: Hire slowly, Fire fast!
mental gymnastics
2. The time that the client said yes way too quickly/
client was ambitious
normally charge $1K but now going to $5K
put the number out and was nervus
client didn't flinch
too happy
didn't realize many things until too late
no profit on that project
every other quote he took was 3X 
even if he screwed it up, still hire other dev
Marinate in the problem space
Now he asks, tell me how you tried to solve this
sit in it and ask more questions
3. The time I built and sold my first company by 30
big milestone for him
sacrificed everything to sell this company
no confetti from the sky
no cameraman asking where he is going
just got up the next day
and just another day
no friends left other than the other people who sold the company
3 year lockout
ended up after all is done $30K for all that work
Lesson: Choose Wisely: Not every choice will pay off equally
changed the rest of his life
he realized he had to optimize for other things, not just the job
4. The time he stayed at a job too long because I didn't create options
daughter is 13
wanted a boyfriend
she thought it would last forever
seems like that but no
He had a job early, was way too 
We all have  a "Best Used By" dates. Network and create options
automation comes for us all
all the investment in the how is not helpful
in the why is fantastic
if you have stopped learning, you have reached your best buy date
WordCamp attendees are in a good position ot learn new things
5. The time I paid attention to the comments on my blog
eventually we all get mean commnets
slow to remove bad 
once as a preacher made 100 house key copies
gave to congregation
permission granted to take anything from the fridge
just hit delete
don't let people spray paint your walls
Always look at the big picture
Know that you'll win and lose
You'll get better over time
Play with people better than you
Can't keep playing and not get better, can't keep building to not get better
need to put in the time or energy
hired an entitled young lady
admin work at the house
house too cold for her
buy a jacket
She "does not learn by ___", no matter what he asked her to learn
own if you don't want to learn
but most people do want to learn
give your self space and time to learn
invest in yourself as a client
Persistance is a super power, available to all of you
Elevate 
instead of stepping up your game, shine a light
ask them enough questions, can brag on them as your new friend
promote others
call people out on what they are good for
don't compete at camps, just elevate everyone
Empower
ask people for help
and help others
easy to forget to look behind us at people that 
Engage
instead of joining the community
connect two others

[SEO Eavesdropping: Spying on the Experts](https://2019.asheville.wordcamp.org/session/seo-eavesdropping-spying-on-the-experts/)
[Leah Quintal](https://twitter.com/quintaleah)


Raw Notes:
SEO refresher
SEO is one piece of your marketing efforts
how people find your website from search engine
people return to your site and that is where conversions happen
if people search for your brand, you have made it!
people don't search this way mostly
traffic captured by pages and posts 
"Best stat trek captain"
350 searches a month
rich search results
want to argure search result findings
click on link
see what page had content with this
450 searches a month
cat themed clothing
how they make money
land on page for purchase, maximize potential sales
'free earrings' 'Fathers day sale'
Who are we spying on?
REI - ecommerce - one of most successful SEO campaigns ever
Meowingtons - ecommoerce
Water use it Wisely -  nonprofit
Finger lakes premier properties
personal finance blog
ahrefs tool for SEO and search 
REI SEO Content Masters
3.1M keywords
7.6M visitors a month
89 Site Authority score
Top Folders
expert advice and co-op journal
521 keywords on pages on expert advice 
Good content architecture maks it all possible
Sleeping pad, 12,000 searches per month 
appears for 1669 keywords
optimizing for a topic
2nd in search results
REI sleeping pad page is for buying pads
links to 'how to buy sleeping pages'
expert advice is lower but still on page 1
educational post gets double the traffic of the product section!
product searches are most often education-seeking searches first
Marathon Training
9500 visits a month on this one post
3500 different keywords
SEO spying is a great way to understand competitor's position on it
You have to produce a LOT of content and see what rises to the top
how much time and energy are you able to spend
even 2 posts a month will add up over a year
then have the data to see what worked
if you have an REI budget, go for it
keep doing it
"how to clean climbing shoes" 
Interlink to product pages and supporting posts from educational content
Becoming an authority is about building your brand
ahref tool let's you do this snooping
its about shifting perspective on how content works
Meowingtons
58K visitors a month

cat puns
far down on first page
to get to blog go to footer 
goal is to arrive on the main page from the blog, not promoting blog itself
search orange tabby cat
people ask a lot of questions about cats online
metadata is what appears in search results
use catchy titles, descriptions, and content anges to stand out in search results and earn more clicks
14 purrfect Puns for your Pun-Loving Valentine

[Why doesn’t it do that, and all the other things WordPress actually does](https://2019.asheville.wordcamp.org/session/why-doesnt-it-do-that-and-all-the-other-things-wordpress-actually-does/)
[John McCulley](https://twitter.com/johnnymackcodes)




Raw Notes:
Being a bigger geek does not make a better dev
A good WP dev has three essential skills
use human words - Javascript is not a human word
practice
ESP - body language
1. Simplify 
Declutter the interface
Move the custom fields up
Choose admin notices wisely
Actually use the dashboard widgets
Tip 2
Avoid Jargon
practice training people who do not know
if words are confusing, replace them in your vocabulary
tip 3
Do it in their space
Test on all browser?  Opera? Old, old Safari
the site is not done when it is done, always making changes
don't stand behind them
don't touch them
don't ask to drive, make sure their hands are on the mouse the whole time
screen options Menu
Make sure needed fields are exposed
you can modify CSS on these parts
Tip 5 
Provide short screencasts
pro versions is not their site
using their site is better by a lot
cropping a featured image for the Trends page
a plugin that warns to crop
tip 6
Prepare, prepare, prepare
this is an important step!
got caught with a redirect loop on a site in front of 38 Marketing Managers
if debug to true then admin notices show up and clients freak about this
do this incognito behind their back
if statment to turn on only from Admin IP address
debug to console code, 
Tip 7 
Create an agenda
learned hard way, training group, 3 people for an hour
5 hours later they were still asking questions
bill by hour so need to scope hours
always ask what other training topics they want before the training
Tip 8
Do I use a page,post or custom post type?
whose blog did you read? 
Terms at the end of training, defining terms 
Pages - static
Posts - we will update
CPT - data sets
lawyer bios example
Tip 9 
Recap!
boom. done. 
we don't know if they got trained
run back over everything at the end
look for confusion
go back over things
re-educate and charge them more money
Tip 10
Sit still and be quiet
People will tell you what they need
selling opportunity
moving on to Guetenberg
and his never-ending struggle with page builders/editors
loves to hate things if don't know what it is yet
Totally borrowed from Pantheon
If you are going to use it
this is not for fresh website tip
1. prepare, think about what the tool will do
staging site is the right approach
2. Design
can do functional great things 
themes are not designed 
3. Extend
painfully easy to extend
not super hard to learn JS
tinkering
have to spend time with it
by extending it you can break it
unit tests and staging sites can make it work
can be a great thing if we make it great

[Taking WordPress on the Road](https://2019.asheville.wordcamp.org/session/taking-wordpress-on-the-road/)
[Russell Fair](https://twitter.com/rfair)

Raw Notes:
Lighting talk
never Start your talk with an apology
so he is starting with a joke
Why did the Jr. Dev quit?
after 2 years of work he still get a raise?
Apology is that if you have not seen these pics it is because he sucks at social media
camping hacks in general
All you need is 2 bard of Verizon 4g to push to Git
not good enough for anything else
learned how to monitor amps
DC-AC and then the TV sucks power
monitors with DC input, can hack to make them run off battery
deep cycle marine battery do not produce clean enough power for running a mac
1 amp from a raspberry pi
airplane mode from Norcross
when you dont have internet, loading WP backend takes forever and does not work
go Master WP-CLI and your productivity will go 1000% higher
learn Bash as well
.bashrc file, move commands to auto run on the server side with differnet user accounts
much faster if bad wifi
Redundancy - lot of benefits
electricity, you need to have more than one power supply
backup devices
version control everything
Inspirational thoughts
lot of amazing stuff in the country, even more he hasn't seen
go see it right now
we live in a time when this is possible
easy to get in a habit of not going and enjoying because we 'have to much to do'
