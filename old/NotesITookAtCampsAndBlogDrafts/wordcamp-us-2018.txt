WordCamp US 2018: Deja vu all over again and being happy

For the third time in twelve months, I was afforded the opportunity to visit [The Protestant Vatican](https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/tennessee/nashville/nashville-nicknames/), capitol of [The Volunteer State](https://statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/tennessee/state-nickname/volunteer-state).  I am not sure, but I am sure this nickname influenced the choice of venue for the largest gathering of Open Source volunteers around WordPress in the US.  As I touched down on a cold afternoon at [BNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_International_Airport) I was so very excited to be back because I was thinking of all the amazing people I got to hang out with and all the amazing times I had the previous time.  I also had a touch of a concern I would be comparing this trip to those and it might color this trip with the tarnish of nostalgia.  I am overjoyed to report that though the trip was thick with familiarity, I had the happiest, best time you can imagine [WordCamp US 2018](https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/)

## Sessions


[Bridging the Design and Development Gap with CSS Algorithms](https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/session/bridging-the-design-and-development-gap-with-css-algorithms/)
[Lara Schenck](https://twitter.com/laras126)

Is CSS a programming langiage?
Some people say yes, some strongly disagree.
Impertiative is the how, the control flow
Decraritive the What , no control flow
imperative, JS, Ruby, C++, Python
Declaritive, domain specific, SQL, HTML and CSS fall here
Css is a domian spefici programming language, 100%
Turning complete in 2018
also, Math, variables and functions and conditional logic
specific conference talk from person in Netherlands
@felienne
But everyone can learn it
but if all math not going to get everyone in it
Programming is a nice green pasture 
the languages are pools in the pasture
in Nov 2018 most people still think CSS is not a language
Su talk
Browser internals in under 5min
person talking to server
get data
client http request server byte stream
inside the browser get byte streams
HTML, CSS and JS
code points turned into tokens
assigns to the DOM tree and the CSSOM
those combine to make
Render/Rule tree for all Dom elements
Render blocking
JS must be executed when encountered, so disrupts the render
Layout draws DOM elements
Layout to Paint
like tiny images
Composite, smooshed together into one presence
----
Algorithms
imperative JS
CSS went from whatever, to CSS the programming language
Only have a hammer approach before
now have mental model for what the browser is doing
whiteboard marker now
psudocoding boxes before touch code
inputs, algorithms output
ocean image to specific position
CSS, Grid, Flexbox, var, calc
She got a job and learned so much
now old code seems really bad to her
got the job from WordCamp discussion meeting
Yellow light time
Algorithm: well defined computational procedure takes input and gives output
Long method code smell
too much happening to let anything be useful
cut into litter chuncks
single responsibility principle
Like kitchen tools
CSS terminology 
Selector
prperty: value = declaration
rule
A CSS algorithm is a well defined or ser of declarations that take input and visual output specific thing
Algorithm: Clearfix
Positioning
aspect ratio
assume the size ofthe container, 
arrows with borders
Fluid Type
Fizzbuzz 
you can do it in CSS!
CSS algorithms?  
what is a word for this?
Patterns
another way to say it
.l-features 
grid algorithm
Utility namespace
.u-glue
kinda like an API
cropping
core patten namespace possible
how do you write CSS algorithms
1 Plan on whiteboard
2 Brute force solutiojn that works
3 walk through
4Psudocode
Write smelly CSS
Figure out the algorithm
Give them name/selectors
anything can fit in this structure
be careful how to talkabout CSS
CSS is weird -> CSS is the issue and faulty
just no true
CSS is decraitive and domain specific 
Mindful CSS bell
Read the spec
conclusion
bridge between engineering and design
Engineering, Design and Product
if all speak different languages it is hard
user interface is the thing people touch
HTML, CSS and JS
You can't really learn JS in short time
CSS and HTML you can learn in a few hours


[Moving the Web Forward with WordPress](https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/session/moving-the-web-forward-with-wordpress/)
[Morten Rand-Hendriksen](https://twitter.com/mor10)

2015 - responsive images were not set thing online
WP introduced it in core
shipped to 20% of the web
changed the charts algorithms on the reporting
but seems that after WP 4.4, Rsponsive became normal
we have not been best custodians of the work
5.0 breaks this responsive agreement
flagged in 4/17
Matt says Responsive should not have come to core
he agrees maybe
2015 tech is not what is going to get us to the future
we are 32.5% of the web
what got us here, won't get us to 50%
what got us here was deep commitment to OSS
solving problems in an interesting way and a lot of luck
what gets us to next level is how we work together
story of a desire path at his HQ
this is how the web works, paving cow paths
WP is the cowpath
instead of looking at a new and better spec, 
look at what people are doing and formalize into a standard
when we make WP decisions, we are making them for the web
What does democratize publishing even mean?
Democratize = introducing democratic principles, 
o make available to everyone
publish means make a content available
making content available online accessible to everyone
values of the internet are the principles of WP
Tim Berners Lee definiton
WP can realize the promise of the web
Participation and representation
who speaks for WordPress?
who speaks for the user (the PEOPLE)?
Corporations speak for us with specific interests and goals 
we say nothing while everyone speaks for us
no answer to who speaks for WP
We must claim our seat at the tables of power
it is for every user of the web
to do that, we must first know what we stand for
democratize publishing....what are the necessary conditions to acheive the mission
He has a proposal
3 governing pinciples
1. Accessibility
Was grand idea of web was to make all books and journals in science available to share
2. Privacy
capability we must grant our users
3. Open Governance
for the internet, we need to take part of the conversations
I don't want to talk to you about these things
Not going to talk, inviting other people to talk.....
[Rachel Cherry](https://twitter.com/bamadesigner)
she is the person who says RollTide online
but Accessibility is a passion
A11y is something that can be quite frustrating
"I can't use your website and it is our fault"
no one can say we have not build an inacessible site
and we need to come to terms with that
easy to get to this way, stackoverflow to get it to work
but is it worki g correctly?
are we messing up the DOM with JS?
how do we force tooling?
Scans in core, will make better for all users
huge % of how people work woth WP is Themes and Plugins
We must understand ARIA as a spec
would love to see a work were A11y is not in plugin, not in the repo
[Leo Postovoit](https://twitter.com/postphotos) on Privacy
thinking about first the core idea
people se data in ways to do whatever they want
need to ask questions about how we use data and the data itself
we do not understand the difference between if I go to the library
no one needs to know my books
but online not the same guarantee
now we have laws
it is the privacy by design that is the fun part and how we can work
we must nudge this ball forward.  
Open Governance
[Chris Teitzel](https://twitter.com/technerdteitzel)
He was inspired by Matt's talk 
he said get involved 
but not much more
Heather Burns
contacted her at WCEU, wanted to collaborate on how to talk governance
spiralled to other CMSes than WP and Drupal
open conversatoin on what we stand for and how regulations work
we are all reactionary
Let's improve together
influnce the people making laws
they are not the people with the knowledge of how it is built
Morten again
5.0 was the last time we should make decisions only for ourselves
with responsive mages we found the edge
e want a seat at the table not to drive the conversation but to 
WordPress Governance Project
http://goo.gl/mvbPYv
join in
example
node and Drupal (early)
AMP just announced
what do those models look like for WP

[WordPress from a Drupal Perspective](https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/session/wordpress-from-a-drupal-perspective/)
[Chris Teitzel](https://twitter.com/technerdteitzel)

Drupal is hard
Play to your strengths
built a site for an app Thememonster
was in Drupal by cooincidence after that
didn't pick it because it was hard
learning WP learned it was not insecure and not that easy for everything
WP strengths
Design and usibility
privacy in core
media management
Robust plugin and theme economy
and yes, Gutenberg
Drupal still needs to do these things and do them well
Drupal strengths
Data architecture - content modeling that happens to make websites
core APIs - forms API for example, makes forms super easy 
VIEWS! - DB querying UI
Rest API in Core
need to play to our strengths
we can learn from each other!
Open libraries should be shared in between.

[Stamping Your Open Source Passport](https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/session/stamping-your-open-source-passport/)
[Drew Gorton](https://twitter.com/dgorton)

Grew up in small america
fish and rice
moved to Spain in his teens
fish and rice vs Pallea 
later in life taught english in Japan over a number of years
another of fish and rice was sushi
elementary school kid would have hated to think about sushi
WP events about 3 years ago
he was also from Drupal
same travel experiences and differences served him well
tech is OSS and that is special kind of tech
Free as in liberty
one thing common, need people to survive and thrive
another interesting thing WP is made of OSS itself
PHP, MySQL, Linux, Apache/NginX
many other tools CMSes like this
57 different ones says Wikipedia
Drupal community is open and there are good events to go to
Or how about PHP events
 - SymfonyCon
 - Sunshine PHP
 Generalist events as well
 An Event Apart, AgentConf, JSConf Hawaii
 Travel gracefully
 - listen first
 - learn, not convert
 - Guides can be a great help!
 - Meet the locals
 - Share your journey


[Scrum for developers](https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/session/scrum-for-developers/)
[Jenny Beaumont](https://twitter.com/jennybeaumont)

Devs work form home
don't like meetings, don't wear pants
got to collaborate with your teams and clients through
SCRUM comes from Rugby
Agil is not the same
interrelated though
cultural hrdles and stereoypes:
idea specific to developers 
causes to feel alone
isolating
fear of change 
Managers can also have a bad rap, get in the way of work
Scrum addresses this with cross functional teams to organize
normal part fo value driven proecss
lot of meetings in scrum, but all have goals for focus
need to understand what ewe are busilding a why.  
are our customers getting value?
rather than build a whole thing, build small increments
deliver quickly and get feedback
meetings sets goals for srpint without defineing how
what we can reasonably deliver
daily scrum is daily and only last for 10-15 minutes
Scrum team
Product Owner
Scrum Master
Dev Team
no managers on team
no one tells the dev team how to do it, they create their own path to the goal
with that freedom brings responsibility
autonomous, need to trust certain things are true
power to get it done
commit to the whole goal
you work hard
that shows in the work
