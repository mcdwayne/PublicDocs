      bio: Agency and Community Success Manager
      I have been working in tech and open source sales since 2005.  I knew as soon as I started working with Java middleware developers I never wanted to work outside of open source ever again.  I first started building in Drupal and WordPress when I needed to build projects for the San Francisco Improv scene.  I fell in the love the community of developers and then found my position at Pantheon at the end of 2013.  
As a Community and Agency Success Manager I have had the privilege of presenting at MidCamp (Drupal), Twin Cities DrupalCamp, DrupalCamp Colorado, WordCamp Milwaukee, WordCamp Baltimore as well as leading BOFs at several other events.  Outside of tech I love producing and performing improv theater.  I also love comic books and karaoke!!!
