Thinking about how Pantheon is organized.

1 - Pantheon is a platform
2 - Architecture (just a single nod to architecture)
3 - Organizational Concepts Overview (triangle)
4 - Sites
	- 3 Environments 
	- Can have multiple team members that help build and maintain the site
	- Can have multiple Organizations connected
	- Will always have an Owner and will use an Upstream
5 - Users
	- Can be associated with multiple sites as individual team members
	- Can be associated with multiple Organizations
	- Can Own Sites And Orgs
6 - Organizations
	- DEFINITION
	- Can Contain Multiple Users
	- Can Contain Multiple Sites
	- Can Own Upstreams
7 - Ownership 
	- DEFINITION
	- Only one User can own a site at a time for Self Serve sites
 	- Ownership is automatically transferred to whoever paid last 
 	- Organizations can own sites in case of contract plans
 8 - Examples 
 	- Pat works for EXAMPLECORP and wants to launch a new site
 	- Pat makes a User Account
 	- Pat does not make an ORG since he is not an Agency 
 	- Pat does make a site EXAMPLECORPSITE	
 	- When Pat is getting ready to launch he invites his CEO Daryl to pay
 	- Daryl becomes the Owner once site is paid, in this case on a Business Plan
 	- EXAMPLECORPSITE gets wildly popular (good job Pat!) and they need managed scale for growing and spiking traffic as well as more mission critical support (24/7 with an SLA)
 	- EXAMPLECORP signs an Elite contract with Pantheon and then the EXAMPLECORP Organization is created on Pantheon, which can then own the site.
