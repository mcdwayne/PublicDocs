WP-CLI -- BUILDING YOUR OWN COMMANDS

Reference:
https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/commands-cookbook/


Add scaffold package command to WP-CLI to the 
wp package install https://github.com/wp-cli/scaffold-package-command#installing
`wp package install git@github.com:wp-cli/scaffold-package-command.git`
NOTE: If fails, can do same form https address and that works


Lando start (starts Lando)

lando wp scaffold package mcdwayne/php-version
"
echo 'Current PHP version : ' . phpversion(). ' \n ';
"

it puts it here (in the docker container):
