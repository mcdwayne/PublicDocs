Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery!  The most import part of the project

When a project goes wrong, most of the time it fails as a result of mismatched expectations.  This can be avoided for most clients by following a repeatable and thorough discovery process.  Understanding how to ask the right questions up front can mean the difference between happy clients who are eager to give you more business and nightmare clients who can never be satisfied.  

This session will focus on:
Asking the right questions
Controlling the conversation
Creating maintainable expectations  
Using discovery throughout your business


--------------------------------
Having been in sales and marketing for the last decade and a half, I have lived through amazing sales cycles and terrible sales cycles.  The biggest difference between the experiences has always come down to one thing, how well I really understood what the client wanted.  This sounds easy but this is one of the most overlooked and hardest to master elements of the entire process.  This session will leave students with not only a desire to do more discovery but also arm them with the tools to practice and perfect their technique.  

A project is a systematic approach to delivering a goal.

an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned and designed to achieve a particular aim.

a planned piece of work that has a specific purpose (such as to find information or to make something new) and that usually requires a lot of time.

Word Root of project
The Latin word jacere, meaning “to throw,” and its form jactus give us the root ject. Words from the Latin jacere have something to do with throwing. To reject is to throw back or away. To eject is to throw out. To inject is to throw one thing into another. To project is to throw forward onto a surface.
