WPCampus 2017 - Good times in Buffalo and fireworks at the Falls

After a couple weekends home in my beloved SF, I was very happy to get to attend my second WPCampus event of the year, this time in Buffalo NY at the lovely Canicious College campus(Link to college site). You might recall back in January I attended [WPCampus Online](/wpcampus-online) from the comfort of the Pantheon HQ.  While the sessions were on par with the live event, it lacked a few things that make a camp a camp.  Namely the hallway track, the dinners and after hours conversations with my #WPLife family and of course #WCKaraoke.  I was very, very glad to get to see my higher ed focused kinfolk and share in the joy at WPCampus 2017!

The Food and the Fun

Flying in overnight, I didn't get as much sleep, but I was overly excited to hear stories from the field, have a lot of meaningful discussions and learn so darn much over these ~2 days that it didn't slow me down at all.  I was very glad to join my fellow WPCampusers at the local watering hole in canalside (NAME OF BAR)(LINK).  We were met with the offical Buffalo staple food, Buffalo Chicken Wings(WIKIPEDIA)! The pretzels and fries I stuck to for appetizers where pretty good.  It always warms my heart to see the awkward start of strangers introducing themselves gives way to camaraderie and new friendships.  We capped the night with my new favorite ultra smooth vodka, Aylesberry Duck at the pretty hip Ballyhoo with those of us too wired up to just go home and sleep yet.  Still, day one of the show was early, so we didn't stay out too late.

Friday 
Breakfast was your normal assortment of pastries and fruit with coffee and tea.  Lunch was a serious step up though, even though we had to walk about a block away to another building on campus.  We were treated to several food stations in the cafeteria, including fresh made sandwiches, salads, tostadas, a few Chinese dishes and excitingly for me vegan mac and cheese and seitan enchiladas.  Lines where a tad longer than anyone would have liked but the quality was pretty good.  
(UPLOAD LUNCH PICS).  The organizers kept us well fed in the mid afternoon with a snack break featuring a popcorn bar, which of course had a buffalo flavor option. (DO PICKS EXIST? CHECK TWITTER)

For Dinner we were left to our own devices and a small gathering of us met up at a local sports bar for some local delicacies.  I like sports bars for larger informal dinners.  They are used to a ruckus and don't mind when a party gets a little loud, which WP people can be at times, as we get excited when hanging out together.  I even got to meet and have my picture taken with the Molson Blue Bear(UPLOAD PIC)

Afterwards a few of us took advantage of the geological proximity to Niagara Falls and went to see the summer fireworks over the Falls.  There is a good reason this is an internationally known destination as pictures do not do justice to the spectacle.  Truly a natural wonder.   The Canadians that went had never seen the US side before and all thought it was adequate, but suggested that I eventually make it over the border to see their view.  If only I had brought my passport.

Saturday
Breakfast was a repeat of the first day.  I was extra thankful for the coffee as my lack of sleep as result of my travel plus the time difference had caught up with me a bit.  Again we traveled to the cafeteria for lunch and this time all the line issues where gone, though the trade off was that the feed as all preprepared wraps and sandwiches with chips and salads.  Again they had a very good vegan option with a "chick'n salad" wrap that was quite filling.  I actually ended up skipping the afternoon snack as a result.  They served cheerio marshmallow squares, yogurt and fruit for that.  

Saturday night brought the After Party.  We gathered at The Expo, a large hall wth several food vendors and a brewcade.  I got there just as they put out our catered food, which was very heavy on the vegan options.  I really appreciated this as it meant I could lay down a substantial layer of pot stickers, sweet potato salad and veggie wraps before I cashed in my drink tickets.  
The organizers of WPCampus are also big fans of the WCKaraoke movement and we had a karaoke dj awaiting us, cranking up the tunes around 8:00pm and kicking things off with a very fun rendition of "Wrecking Ball".  After he went, I was super delighted to hear my fellow WPCampusers go in turn and blow the roof off the place.  Some of the party enjoyed the corn hole ('corn toss' I also heard it called that night) and foseball tables by the bar.  All in all, this was one of the better overall parties of the WordPress world and so many good memories were made.  All to soon the clck struck midnight and we had to evacuate the place bringing an official end to the official activities of the camp.  Really looking forward to next year already!

My Session
I was very honored to be invited to speak on one of my favorite topics, storytelling(Link to the event session page).  I was also flattered that I was given first session slot of the whole event.  This is often the most attended set of sessions of any camp.  We livestreamed the event for those around the world that couldn't make the trip and my video of this will be added to the page linked here, though I don't know when exactly.  The biggest challenges of this particular time giving this talk were a) I had to stand relatively still as I was on a video capture so folks could see my face while presenting. And b) I had moved a few slides around in preparation of the talk thinking I might get a better overall flow, but only throwing me off when I presented.  Still, I had very good recieption.  I am always thrilled when people comment that they see immediate applicability to their work.  Storytelling applies to just so many facets of our lives that this is my currnt favvorite talk I am submitting and am grateful to all the folks who have participated in the sesssions and given me some great feedback.

A survey of WordPress online learning plugins
Chris Lema
@chrislema ???????????
I make no secret that Chris is one of my favorite speakers and I was not dissapointed with this talk on a topic which I will admit I knew almost nothing about going in.  Chris summarized Never been a better time, never cheaper,
Story of Argonne, layoffs, he remained, had to go ask for $2K and that was a lot for equipment for a website project.  
Now is almost all free software.  
People need encouragement
People need certificates
Gave info about a lot of plugins in a nice grid of features, highlighting what each could do
Lunchbox does one thing well, video lessons.  thats it
LearnPress 
Sensei - part fo WooCommerce
liftercms
LearnDash
A product with more features will take more time for configuring!  
Ten mistakes not to make:
1 Don't forget to capture course AND cohort metrics (mixPanel can help with this)
2 Performance metrics - get them, is it working?
3 capture project (cost) metrics
4 Don't forget that you have multiple stakeholders
5 integrate metrics with email notifications
6 Don't forget everyone is using their phones all the time
7 everyone is being interrupted all the time (James patterson effect)
8 Short videos are cheaper to produce and easier to consume,  (shorter better)
9 everyone needs encouragement and motivation
10 don't forget to test everything, NOT just your content.
May not even need a LMS plugin
maybe just protect content
or build basic content for everyone (page builders)
and some forms

Interview like a journalist, write like a marketer: Telling stories with heart…and accuracy
Room 1004
Donna Talarico
Content, HighEdWeb Member
 @donnatalarico

Don't make your subjects sound like robots
Go offline for sources, not all the best stories are (already) online
Don;t be afraid to go the distance 
Think about in person interview, but how to conduct it matters
Build Trust
Observe your subject,
Observe your surroundings.  Pay attention to little details from the environment.  
don't prepare too many questions, let the interview be a conversation
Open ended questions, not yes/no questions
lead them to tell you stories
ask follow up questions
Listen carefully!
Think about your body language
Be quiet, give them room to think and formulate their thoughts
Be humble
Be open
Bring what you need, and bring what you don't need, better to be 
Get your subject's phone unmber just in case
record the conversation as well as your notes
prepare for the weather, maybe plastic bags for your gear
Coming with a team, hide all internal woes, just be professional
Video considerations, lock the door.
Email interviews are not good, impersonal and lazy
surveys are OK with email but too many things 
but people write different than they talk (NYC example)
People don't talk in bulleted lists
You want warmth in your stories, emails are the worst for this
Part 2 - Using your content
Write, then dig - you remember the important parts already
But I don't have time  Or things.

 38% of themes were bad in their inspection
 
 Myth:
 1) Paid is better than free
 2) new better than old
 3) # of downloads == quality
You got to test this stuff out
annoying menus? Any ads? Overlapping plugins?
Performance with New Relic!!! P3 PLugin, StatsD WP Client, xdebug, AWS Cloudwatch Logs
Campuspress code check plugin - freely available and new (being improved)
Git/Bitbucket - code check plugin - test locally
Many small suggestions.

A look at the modern WordPress server stack
Carl Alexander
@twigpress
Used to be simple LAMP and you had afast WP site
Good old days
Now everything wants to load a lot faster
HTML always leads first responce
Nginx FTW! Built for traffic.  Less config needed
you want to hit PHP as little as possible
PHP is a bottleneck
Cache as much as possible HTTP responses
Easy- plugin
middle hard - on server caching (good to handle ddos)
hard but best: Varnish
Easy Engine
